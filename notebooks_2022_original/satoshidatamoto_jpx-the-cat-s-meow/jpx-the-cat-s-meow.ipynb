Purged Times Series is explained [here][1]. There are many configuration variables below to allow you to experiment. Use either CPU or GPU. You can control which years are loaded, which type of models are used, and whether to use feature engineering. You can experiment with different data preprocessing, model hyperparameters, loss, and number of seeds to ensemble. The extra datasets contain the full history of the assets at the same format of the competition, so you can input that into your model too.\n>\n>**NOTE:** this notebook lets you run a different experiment in each fold if you want to run lots of experiments. (Then it is like running multiple holdout validation experiments but in that case note that the overall CV score is meaningless because LB will be much different when the multiple experiments are ensembled to predict test). **If you want a proper CV with a reliable overall CV score you need to choose the same configuration for each fold.**\n>\n\n[1]: TBD","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8af163ff-915a-4fae-aefe-6447e64952e5","_uuid":"b328cc9e-a536-4347-beed-d033e9f5ac6a","papermill":{"duration":0.028098,"end_time":"2021-11-29T16:04:40.679773","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-29T16:04:40.651675","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/pRVvYsf/images.png\" height=250 width=250></center>\n<hr>\n\nCatboost is among the most used algorithms on kaggle and it doesn't look like it is going anywhere soon!\nIt is basiclly a version of gradient boosting machines framework that aims to increases efficiency, speed and performance. \n\n**It is usually one of the main algorithms everyone on Kaggle try when facing a tabular dataset**\n\n><h4>TL;DR: What makes Catboost so great:</h4>\n>\n>1. LGBM was developed and maintained by Yandex themselves so it gets constant maintenance and support.\n>2. Easy to use.\n>3. It is fast.\n>4. A Powerful gradient boosting. \n\n\n<h3>The CatBoost Algorithm</h3>\n\nCatBoost does gradient boosting in a very elegant manner. Below is an explanation of CatBoost using a toy example\n\nLet’s say, we have 10 data points in our dataset and are ordered in time as shown below.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/303/1*K-2XayuU9Y4OklIlDWg1AQ.png\"></img>\n\n> If data doesn’t have time, CatBoost randomly creates an artificial time for each datapoint.\n\n* **Step 1:** Calculate residuals for each datapoint using a model that has been trained on all the other data points at that time (For Example, to calculate residual for x5 datapoint, we train one model using x1, x2, x3 and x4 ). Hence we train different models for different data points . At the end we are calculating residuals for each datapoint that it’s corresponding model has never seen that datapoint before.\n* **Step 2:** Train the model using the residuals of each datapoint\n* **Step 3:** Repeat Step 1 & Step 2 (for n iterations)\n\nFor the above toy dataset, we should train 9 different models to get residuals for 9 data points. This is computationally expensive when we have more number of data points.\nHence by default, instead of training different model for each datapoint, it trains only log(num_of_datapoints) models. Now if a model has been trained on n data points then that model is used to calculate residuals for the next n data points.\n\n* A model that has been trained on first data point is used for calculating residuals of second data point.\n* An another model that has been trained on the first two data points is used for calculating residuals of third and fourth data points\n\nIn the above toy dataset, now we calculate residuals of x5,x6,x7 and x8 using a model that has been trained on x1, x2,x3 and x4.\n\nAll this procedure that I have explained until now is known as ordered boosting\n\n<h4>Random Permutations:</h4>\n\nCatBoost actually divides a given dataset into random permutations and apply ordered boosting on those random permutations. By default CatBoost creates four random permutations. With this randomness we can further stop overfitting our model. We can further control this randomness by tuning parameter bagging_temperature. This is something that you have already seen in other boosting algorithms\n\n<h4>Leaf growth algorithm in CatBoost</h4>\n\nCatboost grows a balanced tree. In each level of such a tree, the feature-split pair that brings to the lowest loss (according to a penalty function) is selected and is used for all the level’s nodes. It is possible to change its policy using the grow-policy parameter.`\n\n<h4>Categorical Feature Handling</h4>\n\nMost of the GBDT algorithms and Kaggle competitors are already familiar with the use of Target Statistic (or target mean encoding).\n\n> It’s a simple yet effective approach in which we encode each categorical feature with the estimate of the expected target y conditioned by the category.\n\nWell, it turns out that applying this encoding carelessly (average value of y over the training examples with the same category) results in a target leakage.\n\nTo fight this prediction shift CatBoost uses a more effective strategy. It relies on the ordering principle and is inspired by online learning algorithms which get training examples sequentially in time. In this setting, the values of TS for each example rely only on the observed history.\n\nTo adapt this idea to a standard offline setting, Catboost introduces an artificial “time”— a random permutation σ1 of the training examples.\n\nThen, for each example, it uses all the available “history” to compute its Target Statistic.\nNote that, using only one random permutation, results in preceding examples with higher variance in Target Statistic than subsequent ones. To this end, CatBoost uses different permutations for different steps of gradient boosting.\n\n<h4>One-Hot Encoding:</h4>\n\n- By default, CatBoost internally represents all the categorical features with One-hot encoding if and only if a categorical feature has two different categories.\n\n- If you would like to implement One-hot encoding on a categorical feature that has N different categories then you can change parameter one_hot_max_size = N.\n\n\n<h4>Handling Numerical Features</h4>\n\nCatBoost handle the numerical features in the same way that other tree algorithms do. We select the best possible split based on the Information Gain.\n\n<h4>The Secret of CatBoost</h4>\n\nCatboost introduces two critical algorithmic advances - the implementation of ordered boosting, a permutation-driven alternative to the classic algorithm, and an innovative algorithm for processing categorical features.\nBoth techniques are using random permutations of the training examples to fight the prediction shift caused by a special kind of target leakage present in all existing implementations of gradient boosting algorithms.\n\n____\n\n\n<h4>Tuning CatBoost</h4>\n\n- **cat_features** — This parameter is a must in order to leverage Catboost preprocessing of categorical features, if you encode the categorical features yourself and don’t pass the columns indices as cat_features you are missing the essence of Catboost.\n\n- **one_hot_max_size** - As Catboost uses one-hot encoding for all features with at most one_hot_max_size unique values. In our case, the categorical features have a lot of unique values, so we won’t use \none hot encoding, but depending on the dataset it may be a good idea to adjust this parameter.\n\n- **learning_rate & n_estimators** — The smaller the learning_rate, the more n_estimators needed to utilize the model. Usually, the approach is to start with a relative high learning_rate, tune other parameters and then decrease the \nlearning_rate while increasing n_estimators.\n\n- **max_depth** — Depth of the base trees, this parameter has an high impact on training time.\n\n- **subsample** — Sample rate of rows, can’t be used in a Bayesian boosting type setting.\n\n- **colsample_bylevel**, **colsample_bytree**, **colsample_bynode**— Sample rate of columns.\n\n- **l2_leaf_reg** — L2 regularization coefficient\n\n- **random_strength** — Every split gets a score and random_strength is adding some randomness to the score, it helps to reduce overfitting.\n\n____\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n<b>Introduction Credits:</b>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href = \"https://www.kaggle.com/shivansh002/your-friendly-neighbour-lightgbm\">Your Friendly Neighbour LightGBM</a> By @shivansh002.
