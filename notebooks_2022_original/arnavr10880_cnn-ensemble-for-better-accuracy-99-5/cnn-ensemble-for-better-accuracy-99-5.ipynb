Suppose like in this set, there are 10 classes, each number representing the equivalent digit:\n\n<h3 align='center'> [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] </h3>\n    \nNow, once one-hot encoding is done using tensorflow, the result can be interpreted in the following way:\n    \n<b>Image at index 3</b>\n\n<code>plt.imshow(x_train[3])</code>\n    \nwhich is the digit <b> 4 </b> (look in the coming cells). Now, to check the <code>y_train</code> for the answer, the result is as shown below:\n\n<code>y_train[3]</code>\n    \n> $ \\begin{bmatrix}\n0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.  \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}  $\n    \nHere, 0 means the digit is not present at this index while 1 means the digit is present at this index (which in this case is it's value). So, the above result means that the value is at index **4** which in this case is it's value.\n    \nWell, this may take a little time to wrap the head around :)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.04847,"end_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.047069","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:50.998599","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"num_classes = 10\n\ny_train = to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=num_classes)\n\nx_train, x_val = x_train[:37000], x_train[37000:]\ny_train, y_val = y_train[:37000], y_train[37000:]\n\nprint(f'Training samples: {x_train.shape}\\nValidation samples: {x_val.shape}\\nTesting samples: {x_test.shape}')","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.054372,"end_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.146067","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.091695","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.340454Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.340773Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.355396Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.340726Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.354043Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.imshow(x_train[3])","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.267878,"end_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.459459","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.191581","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.356638Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.357003Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.581315Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.356959Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.580019Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y_train[3]","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.054486,"end_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.560499","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.506013","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.583287Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.583818Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.591537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.583772Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-03T12:05:54.590411Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4 <b><span style=\"color:#27aee3; font-weight:1200\">|</span> CNN Model","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.046547,"end_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.652757","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-03T07:34:51.60621","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <b><span style=\"color:#27aee3; font-weight:1200\">※</span> How CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) works?<br/>\n\n<center><img width=600 height=600 src='https://www.mdpi.com/entropy/entropy-19-00242/article_deploy/html/images/entropy-19-00242-g001.png'></img></center>\n<br/>\n\nIn mathematics, convolution is the operation of two functions to produce a third\nmodified function.
