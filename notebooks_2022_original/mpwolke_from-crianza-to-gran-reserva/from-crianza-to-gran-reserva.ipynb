What they don’t have in structure they make up for in freshness.\"\n\n\"Crianza is the most accessible level. At the Crianza level, flavors are not as strong.\"\n\nReserva: \"Selected Red wines of the best vintages with an excellent potential that have been aged for a minimum of 3 years, with at least one year in casks.\"\n\nGran Reserva: \"Selected wines from exceptional vintages which have spent at least 2 years in oak casks and 3 years in the bottle. \n\n\"What’s interesting about Gran Reserva is that most winemakers select the best grapes for this level and age them for as long as the wine needs. This means most of the new release Gran Reservas are around 10 years old or older when you first see them available.\"\n\n\n#In summary: Crianza are the most accessible level and Gran Reservas are around 10 years old or older when you first see them available.\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-27T22:46:09.105199Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-27T22:46:09.105661Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-27T22:46:09.115565Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-27T22:46:09.105625Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-27T22:46:09.115018Z"}}}]}
