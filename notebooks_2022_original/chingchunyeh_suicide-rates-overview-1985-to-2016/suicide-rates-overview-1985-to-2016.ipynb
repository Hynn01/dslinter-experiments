According to the suicide rate of each level of age, the rate of elderly is higher, so young people should care more about the elderly. Moreover, the country welfare of the elderly may also impact the rate.\n\nThird, the social pressure. A healthy society can make citizens feel safe and satisfied, so how to relieve the social pressure becomes a significant topic for every country.
