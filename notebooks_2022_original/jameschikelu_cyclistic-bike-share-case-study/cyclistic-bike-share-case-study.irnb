Customers can purchase single ride or day pass, those in this category are referred to as *casual* riders, others can buy annual memberships and they are known as *members*. The company has determined through the finance analyst, that annual members are more profitable and they will be key to future growth. With that knowledge the executive team wants the marketing team to design strategies that can convert casual riders to members.\n\n# 1. Ask\n\n### Business Task\nExplore the data to discover how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Make recommendations that will be approved by the Cyclistic executive, by providing compelling data insights and professional visualizations. The marketing team will use this information to design a strategy that converts casual riders into annual members.\n\n### Stakeholders\n* Lily Moreno - director of marketing for cyclistic, responsible for developing marketing campaigns and initiatives that promote the bike-share program.\n* Marketing analytics team - team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that informs marketing strategy.\n* Executive team - a detail-oriented team that approves all recommendations for the marketing program.\n\n# 2.

Casual riders have longer ride times throughout the week, with longest ride times over the weekends.\n3. Both customer groups have a preference for classic bikes.\n\n#### Recommendations:\n1. Organize more marketing campaigns during summer months and weekends, to get the attention of more casual riders.\n2. Create ads targeting long ride times (>25 minutes), most casual riders fall in this category; emphasize on how they can save more with annual membership.\n3. Campaigns should target leisure riders on Sundays, and ensure classic bikes are mostly available, as casual riders have a higher preference for them.\n\nSee Google Slides presentation for the executive team [here.](http://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AeNDfrTRy9wx5MsdFlbldJzxbfnpCRSrJhaqbD2gZws/edit?usp=sharing)","metadata":{}}]}
