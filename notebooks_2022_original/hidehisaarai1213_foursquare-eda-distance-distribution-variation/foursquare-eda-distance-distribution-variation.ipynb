For example, 'Cafés' should be relatively small, but not so large as to span the street. 'Shopping Malls', on the other hand, are relatively large and could take up an entire city block.\n\nThe distance between matched entities should be roughly proportional to the size of the entity, so if the size varies from category to category, it will appear in the distance between entities per category.\n\nLet's see if there is a difference in distance between matched entities by category.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import haversine_distances\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\n\n\npd.set_option(\"display.max_rows\", 900)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T13:53:30.010759Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T13:53:30.011199Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T13:53:30.015843Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T13:53:30.011149Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T13:53:30.015082Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv(\"../input/foursquare-location-matching/train.csv\")\ntrain.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T14:08:22.976646Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T14:08:22.976928Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T14:08:28.515227Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T14:08:22.976903Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T14:08:28.514361Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Calculate distances between matched entities","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"poi2distances = {}\nfor poi, df in tqdm(train[[\"latitude\", \"longitude\", \"point_of_interest\"]].groupby(\"point_of_interest\"),\n                    total=train[\"point_of_interest\"].nunique()):\n    if len(df) == 1:\n        #
