Here are the part links:\n#### [Part 1. EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mathemilda/part-i-eda)\n#### [Part 2. Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mathemilda/part-2-feature-engineering) (this one)\n#### [Part 3. Machine Learning with accuracy 99.6 on a test set.%](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mathemilda/part-3-machine-learning-with-accuracy-99-6)\n\nI learned in Part 1, EDA and other Kaggle notebooks for Russian Troll dataset that we cannot determine if an account belongs to Russian trolls or not by one post. But we can analyze its activity, like tweet posts times and tweet properties. Now I want to download other data sets and compare them with Russian Troll Tweets to figure out what features could be useful. For this I found on Kaggle [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) and \n[Raw Twitter Timelines w/ No Retweets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/speckledpingu/RawTwitterFeeds). The first one had been harvested before 2009, and I hope that at the time numerous Russian Trolls were not as numerous as afterwards. Unfortunately the tweets are not raw but partially cleaned and in particular emojis are removed. The second set contains American celebrity tweets.\n\nThey are problematic sets because they have too few tweets per account, as you will see below. The reason for this might be that they were harvested for a short period of time. I wish I can get something more suitable and I will appreciate it if somebody can help me with it.\n\n# Outline\n## 1) Download, initial cleaning and preparation for Russian Troll data set and 2 more Kaggle datasets.\n## 2) Counts of different objects in texts\n## 3) Plots\n## 4) Feature calculation\n## 5) Feature selection with Mutual information method and correlations\n___\n My findings\n * The additional datasets which I use do not contain sufficient information comparatively with Russian Troll tweets. As result: \n   * Combined data are not balanced with respect to troll presence.\n   * There are no proper datetime columns so I cannot use clustering by post time.\n   * Amount of posted texts in the additional datasets cannot be used for proper comparison of n-gram frequencies.\n * Nevertheless we can detect differences in account behaviors judging by troll propaganda efforts. Below goes a partial list of their tricks.\n   * Trolls actively use URL, Twitter handles and hashtags to spread their information as wide as possible\n   * It appears that trolls have specific guidelines for message length. \n   * It looks like they tend to use longer words in their messages than normal people do. It could be because they should include particular words and expressions.\n   * I got the same emoji frequency for trolls and non-trolls. The second set was partially cleaned from them, so I believe that usually trolls do not use many emojis. Emoji absence tells us that troll's messages are not personal, just work.\n * Trolls produce a bit more errors in English than non-trolls, although not in a way I expected and they are much less significant for their detection. Nevertheless their usage of punctuation signs slightly differs from native English speakers and can be used for fine distinction.\n \n**Conclusion.** An account behavior analysis can yield good predictors for troll detection. \n\n___\n\n*Remark.* For some reasons a very useful module `ftfy` cannot be found on Kaggle, although it was here a couple of years ago. I have tried to reach the Support team about it and they replied that I should look up the Kaggle forum for help.

They want to use emotional shock because distracted people are not good at rational thinking and I thought that I could use the appearance of an exclamation sign for this, but it did not work out the way I expected. There are other ways to measure a message sentiment level, but they are more involved and I already got a high accuracy with my features, so I left it out. Trolls should include a lot of particular words and expressions. While the words may change with time, the frequent appearance of such propaganda terms does not, thus average word lengths are not very random. Paid posters are likely to have particular guidelines about their message length: not too short, while they are in a hurry to produce a required number of posts, and they often go just above the accepted minimum. With many messages it could be detected as well. \n\nb) **Picking up typical mistakes of native Russian speakers when they use English.** Russian grammar has different rules for commas and dashes. Russian language does not have determiners, so incorrect usage of them can show up. There are other possible mistakes, but they mostly require more involved NLP. \n\nBelow is a function which cleans a tweet and returns for each the following values as a tuple:\n\n * a cleaned tweet\n \n a)\n   * an url count\n   * a hashtag count\n   * a handle count\n   * an exclamation sign count\n   * an emoji and other pictogram count\n   * a cleaned tweet length (meaningful text length)\n   * an average word length in a tweet\n   \n b)\n   * a comma count\n   * a dash count\n   * a determiner 'a' count\n   * a determiner 'the' count\n\nTheir order is changed due to calculation optimization.

It appears that Russian Trolls have a particular guidance about publishing more items which facilitate spreading their message as wide as possible: url weblinks, Twitter handles, hashtags. The interesting thing is that the frequency of emojis is the same for both data sets, although one of the non-troll datasets was cleaned. Looks like normal people tend to use more emojis. I guess they do not have somebody's rules on their feeling expressions. \n\nLet us observe how post lengths and mean word lengths vary between trolls and non-trolls.

At the same time they may often avoid posting messages longer than necessary because they have to type many messages. Their words in general are longer and it could be due to their instructions to repeat particular words and expressions with slight variations.\n\n## 4) Feature calculation\nI decided to compute percentiles for my count variables. This way I can catch differences in distributions. For example, 90 percentile is a data value such that 90% of all entries lie in the histogram to the left of the value.

I decided to use Mutual Information method for this because usual Pearson correlation may fail to detect dependency between random variables when it is not linear. In the same time when the last one is high, then variables are likely to be very similar. The conventional threshold is .7, but it is for variables with normal distribution. We do not have it, so we need to find a suitable maximal value of correlation.\n\nThe scikit-learn module contains feature selection methods which use Mutual Information. There are 2 ways it could be applied: \n * Choosing a specified number of features with the highest MI scores\n * Choosing a specified percentage of features with highest scores.\n \nI want to choose features with MI higher than a provided threshold and drop highly correlated ones. The correlation will be checked with the Pearson correlation because it is much faster to compute than MI score. In a highly correlated pair I prefer to keep a column with a higher MI score. So both of the scikit-learn methods are unsuitable for me.\n\nYou can see below how some of my variables are correlated, especially when we look right above the matrix main diagonal, and how percentiles of the same count might not correlate much.
