These solutions have relied on detailed information about how to trade the assets. \nHowever, do to the nature of financial trading [specifically speaking: No \"clearly defined\" target]. A reinforcement learning approach might fit the problem of cryptocurrency trading well.\n\nIn this baseline notebook, I'll try and use reinforcement learning to build an intelligent agent without the use of a supervised target. Instead, we will gradually refine the agent's strategy over time, simply by trading the assets historicly  trying to maximize the the prediction of the target.\n\nSince this is a starter notebook, we won't be able to explore this complex field in detail, but I hope to share about the big picture and explore some code that you can then use and improve yourself.\n\n### From Supervised Neural Networks to Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\nIt's difficult to come up with a perfect heuristic. Improving the heuristic generally entails trading the assets many times, to determine specific cases where the agent could have made better choices. And, it can prove challenging to interpret what exactly is going wrong, and ultimately to fix old mistakes without accidentally introducing new ones.\n\nWouldn't it be much easier if we had a more systematic way of improving the agent with trading experience?\nWe'll just replace the supervised target with a neural network to estimate what should have been the target at the current observation state. \nThe network accepts the current market features as input. And, it outputs a value that is then used for trading.\n\nThis way, to encode a trading strategy, we need only amend the weights of the network so that for every possible market condition, it assigns higher probabilities to better trades.\nAt least in theory, that's our goal. In practice, we won't actually check if that's the case -- since remember that there are infinite possibilies for market conditions.\n\n\n### Reinforcement Learning\nThere are many different reinforcement learning algorithms, such as DQN, A2C, and PPO, among others. All of these algorithms use a similar process to produce an agent:\n\nInitially, the weights are set to random values.\nAs the agent plays the game [Or trades the assets], the algorithm continually tries out new values for the weights, to see how the cumulative reward is affected, on average. Over time, after playing many games, we get a good idea of how the weights affect cumulative reward, and the algorithm settles towards weights that performed better.\n\nOf course, we have glossed over the details here, and there's a lot of complexity involved in this process. For now, we focus on the big picture!\nThis way, we'll end up with an agent that tries to win the game (so it gets the final reward of +1, and avoids the -1 and -10) and tries to make the game last as long as possible (so that it collects the 1/42 bonus as many times as it can).\nYou might argue that it doesn't really make sense to want the game to last as long as possible -- this might result in a very inefficient agent that doesn't play obvious winning moves early in gameplay. And, your intuition would be correct -- this will make the agent take longer to play a winning move! The reason we include the 1/42 bonus is to help the algorithms we'll use to converge better. Further discussion is outside of the scope of this course, but you can learn more by reading about the \"temporal credit assignment problem\" and \"reward shaping\".\nIn the next section, we'll use the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to create an agent.\n\n### Code\nThere are a lot of great implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms online. In this course, we'll use Stable Baselines.\nCurrently, Stable Baselines is not yet compatible with TensorFlow 2.0. So, we begin by downgrading to TensorFlow 1.0.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.023355,"end_time":"2021-11-30T15:32:33.47427","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-30T15:32:33.450915","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <span class=\"title-section w3-xxlarge\" id=\"install\">Installations üíæ</span>\n<hr>","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024118,"end_time":"2021-11-30T15:32:33.522212","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-30T15:32:33.498094","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install 'tensorflow==1.15.0'\n!apt-get update\n!apt-get install -y cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev\n!pip install \"gym==0.19.0\"\n!pip install \"stable-baselines[mpi]==2.9.0\"","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"papermill":{"duration":168.9391,"end_time":"2021-11-30T15:35:22.485645","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-30T15:32:33.546545","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-23T16:45:58.382038Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-23T16:45:58.382394Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-23T16:50:28.30569Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-23T16:45:58.382301Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-23T16:50:28.304305Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <span class=\"title-section w3-xxlarge\" id=\"outline\">Libraries üìö</span>\n<hr>\n\n#### Code starts here ‚¨á","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.261729,"end_time":"2021-11-30T15:35:23.01198","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-30T15:35:22.750251","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport json\nimport random\nimport datetime\nimport traceback\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport jpx_tokyo_market_prediction\n\nimport gym\nfrom gym import spaces\nfrom stable_baselines import PPO2\nfrom stable_baselines.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv\nfrom stable_baselines.common.policies import MlpPolicy, MlpLnLstmPolicy","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":5.837384,"end_time":"2021-11-30T15:35:29.113776","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-30T15:35:23.276392","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-23T16:50:28.308447Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-23T16:50:28.308751Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-23T16:50:34.165275Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-23T16:50:28.308713Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-23T16:50:34.164022Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WINDOW_SIZE = 5","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.262389,"end_time":"2021-11-30T15:35:29.634315","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-30T15:35:29.371926","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-23T16:50:34.167565Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-23T16:50:34.168026Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-23T16:50:34.172842Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-23T16:50:34.167973Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-23T16:50:34.171743Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <span class=\"title-section w3-xxlarge\" id=\"loading\">Data Loading üóÉÔ∏è</span>\n<hr>\n\nThe data organisation has already been done and saved to Kaggle datasets.

And the second one is its clipped version, which doesn't allow us to destroy our current policy based on a single estimate, because the value of $\\hat{A}_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(s,a)$ is noisy (as it is based on an output of our network).\n\nWhen applying PPO on the network architecture with shared parameters for both policy and value functions, in addition to the clipped reward, the objective function is augmented with an error term on the value estimation and an entropy term to encourage sufficient exploration. Final loss then becomes:\n\n$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}[-J(\\theta) + c  (V_\\theta(s) - V_{\\text{target}})^2 - c_{\\text{ent}}  H(s, \\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot))], $$\n\nwhere $c$ and $c_{\\text{ent}}$ are both hyperparameter constants.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.26116,"end_time":"2021-11-30T15:36:29.857977","exception":false,"start_time":"2021-11-30T15:36:29.596817","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## OpenAI's stable baselines\nTo use this on the competition, we should implement it from scratch since we are not allowed to use internet on the final submissions. \nCurrently, to get things up and running: We are simply going to use OpenAI's stable-baselines. \nAs this is a work in progress: The next versions of this notebok will contain an ecapsulated implementation of the PPO agent.
