Introduction</h1><a id = \"1\" ></a>\n\nWhat is feature engineering?\nFeature engineering refers to a process of selecting and transforming variables/features in your dataset when creating a predictive model using machine learning.\n\n\nWhat is Feature Selection?\nFeature selection is the process where you automatically or manually select the features that contribute the most to your prediction variable or output.\n\nEveryone can just pass data from models using sklearn or do automl stuffs using pycaret or any other python library but the idea is what will make the winners different from rest of us so answer is very simple: feature engineering and selection phases of machine learning pipeline will.\n\nThe idea that there are different ways to represent attributes in a model, and that some of these representations are better than others, leads to the idea of feature engineering - the process of creating representations of data that increase the effectiveness of a model.\n\nNote that model effectiveness is influenced by many things. Obviously, if the attribute has no relationship to the outcome then its representation is irrelevant. However, it is very important to realize that there are a multitude of types of models and that each has its own sensitivities and needs. For example:\n\n- Some models cannot tolerate attributes that measure the same underlying quantity (i.e., multicollinearity or correlation between attributes).\n- Many models cannot use samples with any missing values.\n- Some models are severely compromised when irrelevant attributes are in the data.\n\nFeature engineering and variable selection can help mitigate many of these issues. The goal of this notebook is to help practitioners build better models by focusing on the attributes. “Better” depends on the context of the problem but most likely involves the following factors: accuracy, simplicity, and robustness. To achieve these characteristics, or to make good trade-offs between them, it is critical to understand the interplay between attributes used in a model and the type of model. Accuracy and/or simplicity can sometimes be improved by representing data in ways that are more palatable to the model or by reducing the number of variables used.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.191072Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.191384Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.197313Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.191355Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.195977Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009/winequality-red.csv\")\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.199197Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.199684Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.236855Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.199639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.235913Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-action active\">2. Visualizing Numeric Features</h1><a id = \"2\" ></a>\n\nOne of the first steps of the exploratory data process when the ultimate purpose is to predict the output, is to create visualizations that help get knowledge of the output and then to uncover relationships between the attributes and the output. Knowledge about the output can be gained by creating a histogram or box plot.\n\nImportant characteristics between attributes can be identified by examining\n\n- Scatter plots of individual Attributes and the output labels,\n- A pairwise correlation plot among the Attributes,\n- A projection of high-dimensional Attributes into a lower dimensional space,\n- Line plots for time-based Attributes,\n- The first few levels of a regression or classification tree,\n- A heatmap across the samples and Attributes, or\n- Mosaic plots for examining associations among categorical variables.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"These visualizations provide insights that should be used to inform the initial models. It is important to note that some of the most useful visualizations for exploring the data are not necessarily complex or difficult to create. In fact, a simple scatter plot can elicit insights that a model may not be able to uncover, and can lead to the creation of a new attributes or to a transformation of a attributes or the output that improves model performance. The challenge here lies in developing intuition for knowing how to visually explore data to extract information for improvement.\n\nSo, lets focus on Univariate visualizations. These plots are used to understand the distribution of a single variable. A few common univariate visualizations are box-and-whisker plots (i.e., box plot), violin plots, or histograms.\n\nSkewness also plays key role in understanding the distribution of the attribute will elaborate on skewness further in the notebook.\n\n![](https://www.biologyforlife.com/uploads/2/2/3/9/22392738/c101b0da6ea1a0dab31f80d9963b0368_orig.png)\n\nIn this notebook I will cover following plots for Univariate visualizations:-\n\n- Box Plots\n- Violin Plots\n- Histograms ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-success\"> 2.1 Box Plots</h2><a id = \"2.1\" ></a>\n\nBecause the foremost goal of modeling is to understand variation in the attribute, the first step should be to understand the distribution of the attribute. For a continuous attribute such as the Free Sulfur Dioxide attribute, it is important to understand if the attribute has a symmetric distribution, if the distribution has a decreasing frequency of larger observations (i.e., the distribution is skewed), if the distribution appears to be made up of two or more individual distributions (i.e., the distribution has multiple peaks or modes), or if there appears to be unusually low or high observations (i.e outliers).\n\n**Box Plot** help us visualize distribution of single attribute which further help us understanding dataset. \n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2c21SkzJMf3frPXPAR_gZA.png)\n\nMoving towards technical definition of Box Plots it is a method for graphically demonstrating the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles. In addition to the box on a box plot, there can be lines (which are called whiskers) extending from the box indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, thus, the plot is also termed as the box-and-whisker plot and the box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers that differ significantly from the rest of the dataset may be plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers on the box-plot. \n\n\n**Median**\nThe median (middle quartile) marks the mid-point of the data and is shown by the line that divides the box into two parts. Half the scores are greater than or equal to this value and half are less.\n\n**Inter-quartile range(IQR)**\nThe middle “box” represents the middle 50% of scores for the group. The range of scores from lower to upper quartile is referred to as the inter-quartile range. The middle 50% of scores fall within the inter-quartile range.\n\n**Upper quartile**\nSeventy-five percent of the scores fall below the upper quartile.\n\n**Lower quartile**\nTwenty-five percent of scores fall below the lower quartile.\n\n**Whiskers**\nThe upper and lower whiskers represent scores outside the middle 50%. Whiskers often (but not always) stretch over a wider range of scores than the middle quartile groups.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from plotly import express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nfig = go.Figure(px.box(df, y = 'free sulfur dioxide', title = 'Box Plot of Free Sulfur Dioxide'))\nfig.update_layout(title_x=0.5)\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.238531Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.23874Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.329589Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.238716Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.329011Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If we try to interpret above box plot it has lots of outliers all values greater thar 42 are considered as outlier.

For example, a census focused on the demography of a country may use a histogram to show how many people are between the ages of 0 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30, 31 - 40, 41 - 50, etc. This histogram would look similar to the example below.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure(px.histogram(df, x = 'sulphates', title = 'Histogram of Sulphates'))\nfig.update_layout(title_x=0.5)\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.699744Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.700907Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.803005Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.700865Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.802045Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can consider how to define the y-axis.

Engineering Numeric Attributes </h1><a id = \"3\" ></a>\n\n\n\nAttributes which are continuous are subject to have problems with modeling process. For example, models that construct relationships between the attributes and the output that are based on the rank of the attribute values rather than the actual value, like trees, are immune to attribute distributions that are skewed or to individual samples that have unusual values (i.e., outliers). Other models such as K-nearest neighbors and support vector machines are much more sensitive to attributes with skewed distributions or outliers. Continuous attributes that are highly correlated with each other is another regularly occurring scenario that presents a problem for some models but not for others.\n\n\n\nContinuous attributes with commonly occurring issues. The attributes may:\n\n- Be on vastly different scales.\n- Follow a skewed distribution where a small proportion of samples are orders of\nmagnitude larger than the majority of the data (i.e., skewness).\n- Contain a small number of extreme values.\n- Be censored on the low and/or high end of the range.\n- Have a complex relationship with the output and be truly predictive but\ncannot be adequately represented with a simple function or extracted by\nsophisticated models.\n- Contain relevant and overly redundant information. That is, the information\ncollected could be more effectively and efficiently represented with a smaller,\nconsolidated number of new attributes while still preserving or enhancing the\nnew attributes relationships with the output.\n\nThe techniques in this notebook have been organized into three general categories.\n\n- 1:1 Transformations\n- 1:Many Transformations\n- Many:Many Transformations","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-success\"> 3.1 1:1 Transformations</h2><a id = \"3.1\" ></a>\n\nThere are a variety of modifications that can be made to an individual attribute that might improve its utility in a model.

The Box-Cox procedure, originally intended as a transformation of a model’s outcome, uses maximum likelihood estimation to estimate a transformation\nparameter $\\lambda$ in the equation\n\n\n![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRkHjrl213TAXMJVBHK3yVaRLxxi-_dUqPJxg&usqp=CAU)\n\nIn this procedure, $\\lambda$ is estimated from the data. Because the parameter of interest is in the exponent, this type of transformation is called a **power transformation**. Some values of $\\lambda$ map to common transformations, such as $\\lambda$ = 1 (no transformation), $\\lambda$ = 0 (log), $\\lambda$ = 0.5 (square root), and $\\lambda$ = −1 (inverse). As you can see, the Box-Cox transformation is quite flexible in its ability to address many different data distributions. \n\n**It is important to note that the Box-Cox procedure can only be applied to data that is strictly positive.**\n\nTo address this problem, **Yeo and Johnson (2000)** devised an analogous procedure that can be used on any numeric data.\n\nAlso, note that both transformations are unsupervised since, in this application, the outcome is not used in the computations. While the transformation might improve the attribute distribution, it has no guarantee of improving the model. However, there are a variety of parametric models that utilize polynomial calculations on the attribute data, such as most linear models, neural networks, and support vector machines. In these situations, a skewed attribute distribution can have a harmful effect on these models since the tails of the distribution can dominate the underlying calculations.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can implement Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformation using sklearn's power transforamation.

On the extremes, when the data are absolute zero or one, a small constant can be added or subtracted to avoid division by zero. Once model predictions are created, the inverse logit transformation can be used to place the values back on their original scale.

Centering a predictor is a common technique. The predictor’s training set average is subtracted from the predictor’s individual values. When this is applied separately to each variable, the collection of variables would have a common mean value (i.e., zero). Similarly, scaling is the process of dividing a variable by the corresponding training set’s standard deviation. This ensures that that variables have a standard deviation of one. \n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*aR0ivCUZJjM9DFDw.png)\n\nAlternatively, range scaling uses the training set minimum and maximum values to translate the data to be within an arbitrary range (usually zero and one). Again, it is emphasized that the statistics required for the transformation (e.g., the mean) are estimated from the training set and are applied to all data sets (e.g., the test set or new samples). These transformations are mostly innocuous and are typically needed when the model requires the predictors to be in common units. For example, when the distance or dot products between predictors are used (such as K-nearest neighbors or support vector machines) a standardization procedure is essential.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nx_density = (df['density'] - df['density'].mean())/df['density'].std()\n\nfig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, \n                    subplot_titles=(\"Histogram of Density before transformation\", \"Histogram of Density After transformation\"))\n\nfig.append_trace(go.Histogram(x = df['density']), row = 1, col = 1)\n\nfig.append_trace(go.Histogram(x = x_density), row = 1, col = 2)\n\nfig.update_layout(height=600, width= np.inf, title_text=\"Distribution of Density before and after Centring transformation\", showlegend=False, title_x = 0.5)\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.937828Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.938303Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.984069Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.938264Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-28T13:25:58.983003Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h2  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-success\"> 3.2 1:Many Transformations</h2><a id = \"3.2\" ></a>\n\n1:Many transformations can be made on a single numeric predictor to expand it to many predictors.

For a continuous attribute x, a quadratic basis expansion is\n\n![](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/machine-learning-polynomial-regression.png)\n\nTo use this basis expansion in the model, the original column is augmented by one new features with squared version of the original. The b(b0, b1 and, b2) values could be estimated using basic linear regression. If the true trend were linear, the rest one regression parameters would presumably be near zero (at least relative to their standard error). Also, the linear regression used to determine the coefficients for the basis expansion could be estimated in the presence of other regressors. \n\nThis type of basis expansion, where the pattern is applied globally to the attribute, can often be insufficient. Because at some local point trends may be increase but according to global function(basis expansion) it is decreasing in nature. An alternative method to creating a global basis function that can be used in a regression model is a **polynomial spline**. \n\nHere, the basis expansion creates different regions of the predictor space whose boundaries are called knots. \n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Parametic_Cubic_Spline.svg/1200px-Parametic_Cubic_Spline.svg.png)\n\n\nThe polynomial spline uses polynomial functions, usually cubic, within each of these regions to represent the data. We would like the cubic functions\nto be connected at the knots, so specialized functions can be created to ensure an overall continuous function. Here, the number of knots controls the number of regions and also the potential complexity of the function. If the number of knots is\nlow (perhaps three or less), the basis function can represent relatively simple trends.\nFunctions with more knots are more adaptable but are also more likely to overfit the\ndata.\n\nIn above image we created 5 different polynomial regions means 5 different polynomial regression equations and then join them all after smoothing in one.\n\nThe knots are typically chosen using percentiles of the data so that a relatively equal\namount of data is contained within each region. For example, a spline with three\nregions typically places the knots at the 33.3% and 66.7% percentiles. Once the\nknots are determined, the basis functions can be created and used in a regression\nmodel. There are many types of polynomial splines and the approach described here\nis often called a natural cubic spline.\n\nHow many knots should be used?

Feature Selection</h1><a id = \"4\" ></a>\n\nIn 3rd section of this notebook we have studied tools for engineering features (or attributes) to\nput them in a form that enables models to better find the predictive signal relative\nto the outcome. Some of these techniques, like 1-1 transformations or dimensions\nreduction methods, lead to a new predictor set that has as many or fewer attributes\nthan the original data. Other transformations, like basis expansions, generate more\nfeatures than the original data. \n\nThe hope is that some of the newly engineered\nattributes capture a predictive relationship with the outcome. But some may not\nbe relevant to the outcome. Moreover, many of the original attributes also may not\ncontain predictive information. **For a number of models, predictive performance is\ndegraded as the number of uninformative attributes increases. Therefore, there is a\ngenuine need to appropriately select attributes for modeling.**\n\n\nOne Question can ask a Question at one phase of ML process we created features using feature engineering techniques and at another phase we are try to remove few features. The answer is pretty simple both phases are important in Machine Learning. We have seen importance od feature engineering lets focus our discussion on feature scaling now. \n\n- Some models, notably support vector machines and neural networks, are\nsensitive to irrelevant attributes.\n\n- Other models like linear or logistic regression are vulnerable to correlated\nattributes. Removing correlated attributes will reduce multicollinearity\nand thus enable these types of models to be fit.\n\n- Even when a predictive model is insensitive to extra attributes, it makes good\nscientific sense to include the minimum possible set that provides acceptable\nresults. In some cases, removing attributes can reduce the cost of acquiring\ndata or improve the throughput of the software used to make predictions.\n\nRest of the notebook will focus on supervised feature selection where the choice of which attribute to retain is guided by their effect on the outcome.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n<h2  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-success\"> 4.1 Classes of Feature Selection Methodologies</h2><a id = \"4.1\" ></a>\n\n\nFeature selection methodologies fall into three general classes:\n- Intrinsic (or implicit) methods.\n- Filter Methods.\n- Wrapper methods. \n\n\nIntrinsic methods have feature selection naturally incorporated with the modeling process, whereas filter and wrapper\nmethods work to marry feature selection approaches with modeling techniques. The\nmost seamless and important of the three classes for reducing features are intrinsic\nmethods.\n\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Overview-of-Feature-Selection-Techniques3.png)\n\n\n<h3  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-warning\"> 4.1.1 Intrinsic Methods</h3><a id = \"4.1.1\" ></a>\n\nThere are some machine learning algorithms that perform feature selection automatically as part of learning the model. We might refer to these techniques as intrinsic feature selection methods.\n\nThe most seamless and important of the three classes for reducing features are intrinsic\nmethods.\n\nFew intrinsic methods are penalized regression models like Lasso and decision trees, including ensembles of decision trees like random forest. Although some algorithms, such as random forest, deliberately force splits on irrelevant\npredictors when constructing the tree.\n\nThe main advantage of implicit feature selection methods is that they are relatively fast\nsince the selection process is embedded within the model fitting process; no external\nfeature selection tool is required.\n\nThe main downside to intrinsic feature selection is that it is model-dependent. In addition, some\nintrinsic models (like single tree models) use a greedy approach to feature selection.\nGreedy approaches usually identify a narrow set of features that have sub-optimal\npredictive performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-warning\"> 4.1.2 Filter Methods</h3><a id = \"4.1.2\" ></a>\n\nFilter methods conduct an initial supervised analysis (statistics) of the attributes to determine\nwhich are important and then only provide these to the model. Here, the search is\nperformed just once. The filter methods often consider each attribute separately\nalthough this is not a requirement. \n\nHowever, they are prone to over-selecting attributes.\n\nFor filter methods I would like to recommend you this Exhilarating blog on Machine learning mastery I think this blog is the best literature I found for Filter feature selection  \n\n\n[How to Choose a Feature Selection Method For Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-real-and-categorical-data/)\n\n\n![](https://machinelearningmastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/How-to-Choose-Feature-Selection-Methods-For-Machine-Learning.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3  style=\"text-align: center\" class=\"list-group-item list-group-item-warning\"> 4.1.3 Wrapper Methods</h3><a id = \"4.1.3\" ></a>\n\nWrapper methods use iterative search procedures that repeatedly supply attribute\nsubsets to the model and then use the resulting model performance estimate to guide\nthe selection of the next subset to evaluate. \n\nIf successful, a wrapper method will\niterate to a smaller set of attributes that has better predictive performance than\nthe original attribute set. \n\nWrapper methods can take either a greedy or non-greedy\napproach to feature selection. A greedy search is one that chooses the search path\nbased on the direction that seems best at the time in order to achieve the best\nimmediate benefit. \n\nWhile this can be an effective strategy, it may show immediate\nbenefits in predictive performance that stall out at a locally best setting. \n\nA nongreedy\nsearch method would re-evaluate previous feature combinations and would\nhave the ability to move in a direction that is initially unfavorable if it appears to\nhave a potential benefit after the current step. This allows the non-greedy approach\nto escape being trapped in a local optimum.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"An example of a greedy wrapper method is backwards selection (otherwise known\nas **recursive feature elimination or RFE**).
