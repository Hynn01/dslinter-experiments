Octosport, the host of this competition, states in the description of the dataset that:\n\n> The rating features are calculated by Octosport. Ratings are meant to give information on the team's relative strength for a given match. For instance, we would expect that a team with a rating of 10.5 beats a team with a rating of 2.3.\n\nIn a [discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/code/curiosityquotient/investigation-into-rating-feature-octosport/comments), it is further revealed that:\n\n> ...ratings are pairwise and can be seen as a combination of a team's offensive strength and an opponent's defensive strength which is why they are varying in time depending on the fixture.\n\nA research of football prediction models shows that this kind of formulation may be more likely associated with the Poisson models, which use the assessments of the offensive and defensive strength to come up with the expected mean goals of each side, then use Poisson distribution to turn out the probabilities of every possible score lines and thereby the probabilities of home win, draw or away win.
