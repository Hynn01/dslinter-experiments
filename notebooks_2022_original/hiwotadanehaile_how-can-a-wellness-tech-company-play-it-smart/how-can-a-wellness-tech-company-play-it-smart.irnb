Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\nSršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\n**SUMMARY Of BUSINESS TASK**\n\nThe objective of this project is to answer the following:\n\nWhat are some trends in non Bellabeat smart device usage?\n\nHow could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\nHow could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n\n**Stakeholders**** \n\nThe Bellabeat marketing analytics and executive teams, the founder and co-founder of Bellabeat who are Urška Sršen and Sando Mur as well as the existing and potential Bellabeat smart technology users.\n\n**2.0 PREPARE**\n\nData Source\n\nThis project was created using FitBit data that was shared by Mobius through Kaggle under a CC0: Public domain license The data set contains personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring for 30 users.
