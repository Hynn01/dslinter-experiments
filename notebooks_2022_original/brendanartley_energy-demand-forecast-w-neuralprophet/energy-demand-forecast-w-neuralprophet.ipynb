I was surprised how close the SARIMA forecast came to NeuralProphet. It would be interesting to take this a step further and see how these models perform on other time series tasks.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def comparison_plot():\n    \"\"\"Visualizing the training + validation sets\"\"\"\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)\n    ax.set_title(\"Model Comparison\")\n    ax.plot(df_test[\"y\"].values,'.k', label='True Value')\n    ax.plot(last_val_preds, label=\"Last Value\")\n    ax.plot(exp_smooth_preds, label=\"Exponential Smoothing\")\n    ax.plot(sarima_preds, label=\"SARIMA\")\n    ax.plot(neuralprophet_preds, label=\"NeuralProphet\")\n    ax.legend()\n    plt.show()\n    \ndef score_plot():\n    \"\"\"Visualizing the training + validation sets\"\"\"\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)\n    \n    scores = {\n        \"Last Value\": last_val_rmse,\n        \"Exponential Smoothing\": exp_smooth_rmse,\n        \"SARIMA\": sarima_rmse,\n        \"NeuralProphet\": neuralprophet_rmse,\n    }\n    \n    ax.set_title(\"Score Plot\")\n    ax.bar(scores.keys(), scores.values())\n    ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0], label_type='edge')\n    ax.margins(y=0.1)\n    plt.show()\n    \ncomparison_plot()\nscore_plot()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Closing Thoughts\n\nNeuralProphet is a very intuitive framework that is still in the early stages of development. If you want to contribute to this project, you can do so on [Github](https://github.com/ourownstory/neural_prophet). You can also join the NeuralProphet community on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/neuralprophet/shared_invite/zt-18de4n6ef-XyJLYUmkL7ULcj77xcJrmQ)!\n\nI did not include exogenous variables in this notebook but think that these would boost model performance. The predictions from the NeuralProphet model could be used as an input feature to an LGBM/XGBoost model. This would likely yield a very forecast.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### References\n\n1. [Energy for Sustainable Development - MD.
