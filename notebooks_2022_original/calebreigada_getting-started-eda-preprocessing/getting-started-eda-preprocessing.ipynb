Convert non-numeric features into a numerical representation (training + test)\n\nThere are 2 different ways we can go about converting *f_27* characters into a numerical representation. The first way is to one-hot encode each character. The other way is to count how many times each character appeared in the sequence (also called *bag of words*).\nLets take a look at what each of this would look like and weigh the pros and cons.\n\n* Suppose there are 5 unique characters for this example: A->E (*actual dataset has 20 unique characters A->T*)\n* Each data point has exactly 5 characters total (*actual dataset has 10 character total*)\n* Our sample data point is \"ABDBD\"\n\n\n**One-Hot Encoded Representation**\n```\n\"ABDBD\" -> [\n            [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n            [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n           ]\n```\n* **Pros**: Captures order/placement of characters\n* **Cons**: Greatly increases number of features (this example would add 25 features), sparse (mostly 0 values)\n\n**Bag-of-Words Representation**\n```\n\"ABDBD\" -> [1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n```\n* **Pros**: Limited extra features, captures character count\n* **Cons**: Loses all sense of character order\n\n> **Tf-idf (Advanced)**: Tf-idf is a simple twist on Bag-of-Words. It stands for *term frequency-inverse document frequency*. This approach will look at a normalized count where each character count is divided by the number of sequences that character appears in. This method may be better in capturing the meaning of characters that do not appear often. For more information on tf-idf, visit this link: https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/\n\n#### **Moving Forward**\n\nTo keep our data as simple and easy as possible, lets opt for the **Bag-of-Words** approach.

Scale each feature to be between 0-1 (training + test)\n\nNot all features of this data set are on the same scale. Many ML models require that data be on the same scale to properly train.

To do this we will execute the following formula on each feature:\n\n```\nx_new = ( x - min(X) ) / ( max(X) - min(X) )\n```\n*where X is a feature and x is an element of that feature*\n\n\n\n> **Note on scaling:** Scaling is not required for all ML algorithms.

I recommend, for beginners, starting with some of the following models available in the `sklearn` library:\n\n* **Logistic Regression** (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)\n* **Decision Tree** (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)\n\nOnce you understand these basics, a great algorithm (based off of the decision tree) is **XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boost(ing)). \n\nHere is a link for `xgboost`: \n\n> https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html?highlight=XGBClassifier#xgboost.XGBClassifier\n\n\n### Feature Engineering\n\nThere is still a lot left to explore within the features of the dataset. I recommend exploring further how different features relate to the target feature. Based on these relations, you may **create more features that are combinations of two or more features**. An example would be a feature *C* that is feature *A* x feature *B*. Also, the feature ***f_27* needs to be examined in more detail**. There may be important information hidden in all of those seemingly meaningless characters.\n\n\n### Evaluating Performance\n\nThe performance metric for this competition is **Area Under the ROC Curve**. It is very important to understand this to create a winning model. \n\nHere is a link to learn more about AUC (ROC): \n\n > https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-auc-roc-curve-68b2303cc9c5\n\nHere is a function to calculate area under the roc curve, `sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score`:\n\n> https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html\n\n\n\n### I hope this information helped you. Good luck in the competition! 🍀","metadata":{}}]}
