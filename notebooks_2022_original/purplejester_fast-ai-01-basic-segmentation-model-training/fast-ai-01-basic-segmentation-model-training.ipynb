Though I'm not new to Machine Learning in general and Deep Learning in particular, I think that the course provides a great chance to try another problems' solving approach and shares interesting insights about the topic. \n\nThe `fastai` library is developed to be an end-to-end deep learning solution that helps to handle data, train a model, and verify the quality of predictions. It provides classes that help users to deal with various forecasting tasks: classification, regression, image segmentation, etc. In this notebook, we'll follow the first chapter of the [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/) book and [Lecture 1 of the course](https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1). However, instead of training a classification model, we'll train an image segmentation model. I decided to try a different task compared to what is described in the lesson to see how easy it is to switch from one problem to another.\n\nFor this purpose, we'll use [UW-Madison GI Tract Image Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation) dataset. In this kernel, we only train a basic model, without doing any inference or submitting the predicted result. Also, we don't use the original dataset, but [it's pre-processed version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/purplejester/uwm-images-and-masks) that includes the same samples and the original dataset plus decoded segmentation masks. \n\n# Imports and Setup\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from pathlib import Path\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\nfrom fastcore.all import *\n\nset_seed(1, reproducible=True)\n\nDEBUG = True\nDATASET_SIZE = 3000 if DEBUG else 38496  # read only a small subset of data to train some basic model\nDATA_ROOT = Path(\"/kaggle/input/uwm-images-and-masks\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-04T11:31:16.867855Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-04T11:31:16.868192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-04T11:31:19.993064Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-04T11:31:16.868096Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-04T11:31:19.992178Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Reading the data\n\nIn order to read the data, we'll use an instance of `DataBlock` class.

Next, we should figure out data quality issues and see if we can get a better result on the same small subset of data. [In the next notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/purplejester/fast-ai-02-histogram-equalization), we make sure that dataset samples look more reasonable and train a new model to see if it helps to improve the quality of its forecast.","metadata":{}}]}
