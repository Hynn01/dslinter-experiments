Following its release, the game has become increasingly popular worldwide.\n\nIn each match, two teams of 5 players compete by rounds of fixed duration, being the first to win 13 rounds considered the winner team. Each player can choose from a set of agents that have distinct habilities and they can purchase different guns throughout the rounds with credits won according to round result, kills and other game considerations. \n\nOne team will be considered the defender and other the attacker for the first 12 rounds. After that, the roles get inverted and they take on opposite roles. The attacker team in a round has a spike (which is sort of like a bomb) that they need to plant and wait until it detonates to win. If they do not plant the spike, this team can win if they eliminate all the other team's players. On the other hand, the defenders' team need to either defuse the spike or prevent the other players from planting it before the round time runs out. The sets where it all can take place are called maps. Each one has specific places where the spike could be planted, as well as attacker and defender spawn sites.\n\nFirst, we need to retrieve the location of our datasets, and see how many of them we have.

The latest map ever released was Fracture.\n\nIn this section, we will analyze map statistics for the seven of them. \n\nFor each one, we have 10 attributes:\n\n- map, which indicates the map name\n- played, which tells us the percentage of games played on that map\n- avg_spike_plant, which I'm not really sure what it is and [thespike](http://thespike.gg) doesn't clarify\n- rounds, which is the amount of rounds played per map \n- atk_win_rate, which is the win rate when attacking\n- def_win_rate, which is the win rate when defending\n- pistol_atk_win_rate, which is the win rate when attacking on a pistol round\n- pistol_def_win_rate, which is the win rate when defending on a pistol round\n- second_round_conversion_atk, which is the second round conversion after having won a pistol round on attack\n- second_round_conversion_def, which is the second round conversion after having won a pistol round on defense\n\nBefore starting, I performed some basic data cleaning.

Valorant divides its agents in 5 categories, which we list below as well as the corresponding agents for each one:\n\n- **Duelist**: Phoenix, Reyna, Jett, Raze, Yoru and Neon.\n- **Controller**: Brimstone, Viper, Omen and Astra. \n- **Sentinel**: Sage, Cypher, Killjoy and Chamber.\n- **Initiator**: Sova, Breach, Skye and KAY/O.\n\nFor each agent, the dataset provides us with several attributes such as:\n- agent, the name of the agent\n- pick_rate, the pick rate of an agent in matches\n- round, the amount of total rounds played with an agent\n- rating, which I'm not really sure how it is computed\n- ACS, average combat score, a measure of how a player performs in match \n- K/D, which is the kills-deaths ratio\n- ADR, the average damage per round\n- KPR, the average kills per round\n- DPR, the average damage caused per round\n- APR, the average amount of assistences per round \n\nThere are also two extra columns I did not see in the dataset's description and I don't understand, even after looking at the source. Therefore, I won't use them in my analysis. \n\nAs I did with the maps, I am first going to do some very simple data cleaning.

This is something that is given to each player at the end of each match, and takes into account kills, deaths, assistances as well as spike plants and first bloods, to name a few criteria.\n\nFrom this plot, we can make several interesting observations: \n- The ACS is not hugely different among agents. \n- There seems to be no clear relationship between agent pick rate and the ACS. Meaning, people do not necessarily choose more frequently the agents that end up having higher values of ACS, despite ACS determining the MVP for the match and for each team. For example, Phoenix has a high ACS but it is not picked that often. \n- Duelists have the highest ACS, possibly because kills are extremly important when computing this quantity and the role of duelists is more associated with having to kill enemies.

There, we can observe indicators such as the mean damage per round or ACS of Pro Players (and perhaps comparing them to our own statistics? Riot website lets you see your own in game statistics after signing in). From these statistics, besides simply obtaining expected values for the different attributes, we can observe some peculiarities such as:\n- There is a player that played around 8500 rounds when the mean is about 900\n- There is a huge variation in ACS, being 126 the minimum and 322 the maximum. Not necessarily huge ACS is necessary to be a Pro Player, apparently. It is remarkable that the same happens for K/D, another important indicator of performance. Maybe this is due to the fact that there are different roles in the game, and a good sentinel or a good initiator maybe don't kill as many people as a good duelist does (it would be nice to know the usual roles for each player to analyze this). \n- ADR is mostly near one, indicating that Pro Players kill at least one person every round. \n- DPR variate from 0.5 to 0.9, indicating that pro players have a range of dying every two rounds, or each round. \n- APR is pretty low, at around 0.3, and with a small standard deviation.

From here, we can gather a few observations:\n- All the autocorrelations are 1, as one would expect.\n- The amount of rounds played seems to bear no relationship with any other indicators of performance. That means, a higher amount of rounds played doesn't imply someone is better or worse. \n- Indicators of performance such as ACS and rating hold a positive correlation with ADR, KPR and K/D, and a negative correlation with DPR. This makes sense because killing more enemies is an indicator of good performance. On the other hand, dying more could be considered as performing worse. \n- It is remarkable that assistances have a null or negative correlation with ACS, ADR, KPR and K/D. That means, a lot of assistences per round don't seem to make a pro player. If anything, it even seems to influence negatively on quantities like their scores and the amount of enemies they kill. However, the correlation between APR and DPR is negative, which is probably due to the fact that an assist may mean a person did some damage on an enemy and didn't die but, at the same time, didn't do sufficient damage to kill that player.
