They begin with\na data set, then apply their favorite tools and techniques to it. The result is narrow\nquestions and shallow arguments remember <b> Why Before How </b> ,The secret is to have structure that you\ncan think through, rather than working in a vacuum , <b> But how to have that structure  ?</b>\n-  Our first place to find structure is in creating the scope for a data problem\nThere are four parts to a project scope. The four parts are the <b> context </b> of the\nproject; the <b> needs </b> that the project is trying to meet; the <b> vision </b> of what success might\nlook like; and finally what the <b> outcome </b> will be\n\n![](https://2382812164-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-M5Vxy9PzQFOZjhyK8YP%2F-MEXhP-_QL4GqNUVHV2U%2F-MEXpPcIlpFrvqgpPQrE%2Fimage.png?alt=media&token=1c4ad2a4-ca40-49c8-937e-adaa749d02ad)\n### Context (emerge from understanding who we are working with and why they are doing what they are doing):\nthe insurer wants to develop the best medical insurance products, plan a particular insurance outcome, or manage a big portfolios. For all these cases, the objective is to accurately predict insurance costs.\n\n\n#### Explanation of the variables of the dataset :\n-  age: age of primary beneficiary\n-  sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male\n\n-  bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight(kg/m $^2$) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\n \n-  children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents\n\n-  smoker: Smoking\n\n-  region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\n\n-  charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance\n\n### Needs (challenges  that could be fixed by intelligently using data):\n-  can we  boost up the financial performance of a medical insurer ?\n\n### Vision (where we are going and what it might look like to achieve our goal):\n-   train a ML regression model that generates the target column charges more accurately. Being a regression model problem, metrics such as the coefficient of determination and the mean squared error are used to evaluate the model.\n\n### Outcome (is focused on what will happen when we are \"done\"):\n-   medical insurer can approximate the medical costs of each user and develop more accurate pricing models\n\nAt the end of everything, the finished work will often be fairly simple.Because\nof all of the work done in thinking about context and need, vision,\nand thinking about outcomes, our work will be the right kind of simple. <b>Simple\nresults are the most likely to get used.</b>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <b>2 <span style ='color:#83BD75'>|</span> Importing Libraries</b>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.impute import KNNImputer\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\ncolors_nude = ['#E9EFC0','#B4E197','#83BD75','#4E944F'] #if wandring why greens ?to reinforce the emotion (prediction dollar$)\nsns.palplot(sns.color_palette(colors_nude))\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n# Set Style\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\")\nsns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom scipy.stats import norm, skew\nfrom sklearn.metrics import  mean_squared_error ,r2_score , explained_variance_score\nfrom time import time\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.872179Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.873031Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.953852Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.872989Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.952922Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <b>3 <span style ='color:#4E944F'>|</span> Loading the data</b>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/insurance/insurance.csv')\ndf['children'] =df['children'].astype('object')\ndf","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.955934Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.956627Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-08T08:32:10.018643Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-08T08:32:09.956577Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-08T08:32:10.017672Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" Usually ,at that stage i do <b>Data cleaning</b> then <b>EDA </b> but  <b>Data cleaning</b> is the process of modifying data to fit the criteria for a specific problem, and you'll have no idea what you might want to change about a data set until you know what's in it.So  <b>EDA </b> first ,for more info \n(https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers/103089)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <b>4 <span style ='color:#4E944F'>|</span> Exploratory Data Analysis</b>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I have always wondered how to explore data? do I need to do some random cool visualizations that no one understands except me, when I look at people's notebooks I tell myself that I can do that visualization but why particularly he did that? if you have these questions don't worry I will do my best to help you and remind myself\n-  <b> First </b>,The public-facing side of visualization—the polished graphics that you see are fine examples of data graphics at their best,\n    but what is the process to get to that final picture?

We expect that the variability in the response(dependent) variable doesn't increase as the value of the predictor(independent) increases, which is the assumptions of equal variance, also known as **Homoscedasticity**.

Therefore, we can find and fix various assumptions with a few unique techniques.\n\nSo, **How do we check regression assumptions? We fit a regression line and look for the variability of the response data along the regression line.** Let's apply this to each one of them.\n\n**Linearity(Correct functional form):** \nLinear regression needs the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable to be linear.
