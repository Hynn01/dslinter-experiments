I will use Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.pyplot in this notebook\n\n### Dataset Description\n#### Context\nThis dataset is related to red variants of spanish wines. The dataset describes several popularity and description metrics their effect on it's quality. The datasets can be used for classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (i.e. the quality goes from almost 5 to 4 points). The task is to predict either the quality of wine or the prices using the given data.\n\n#### Content\nThe dataset contains 7500 different types of red wines from Spain with 11 features that describe their price, rating, and even some flavor description. \n\n#### Attribute Information\n* **winery**: Winery name\n* **wine**: Name of the wine\n* **year**: Year in which the grapes were harvested\n* **rating**: Average rating given to the wine by the users *[from 1-5]*\n* **num_reviews**: Number of users that reviewed the wine\n* **country**: Country of origin *[Spain]*\n* **region**: Region of the wine\n* **price**: Price in euros *[€]*\n* **type**: Wine variety\n* **body**: Body score, defined as the richness and weight of the wine in your mouth *[from 1-5]*\n* **acidity**: Acidity score, defined as wine's “pucker” or tartness; it's what makes a wine refreshing and your tongue salivate and want another sip *[from 1-5]*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <b>2 <span style='color:#FFB875'>|</span> Preparing the Data</b>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-29T06:34:40.161216Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-29T06:34:40.161766Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.555956Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-29T06:34:40.161651Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.554712Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/spanish-wine-quality-dataset/wines_SPA.csv')\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.558479Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.558973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.636006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.558922Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.634921Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### First lets clean our data and do data validation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.637238Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.637487Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.653117Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.637457Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.650983Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are some null values on our dataset so lets drop them","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.dropna()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.656047Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.656458Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.679131Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.656414Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.678433Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.680719Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.681071Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.688998Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.681023Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.688337Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lets now see some simple statistical information of our numerical columns and lets also see the datasets info","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.69032Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.690899Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.738988Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.690855Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.738113Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.740914Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.741202Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.770434Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.741169Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-29T06:34:41.769677Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I have also noticed that there is a string value that was stopping me to convert the year column into numerical datatype, and it was N.V. value.
