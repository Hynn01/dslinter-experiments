It is a tabular dataset with 900,000 rows and 33 columns (318MB .CSV training dataset + 247MB .CSV test set) that is suitable for training algorithms to solve binary classification problems (in this case to determine if a machine is in a state of \"0\" or \"1\" based off of input sensor data).  \n\nWe'll be using [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests) (TF-DF) to train our model.  TensorFlow Decision Forests is a TensorFlow wrapper for the [Yggdrasil Decision Forests C++ libraries](https://github.com/google/yggdrasil-decision-forests).  TF-DF makes it very easy to train, serve and interpret various Decision Forest models such as [RandomForests](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/api_docs/python/tfdf/keras/RandomForestModel) and [GrandientBoostedTrees](https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/api_docs/python/tfdf/keras/GradientBoostedTreesModel).  These types of decision forest models require minimal pre-processing of the data and are great when working with tabular datasets and/or small datasets (especially if you just want a quick baseline

These types of decision forest models require minimal pre-processing of the data and are great when working with tabular datasets and/or small datasets (especially if you just want a quick baseline result to compare against).  Some of my favorite parts about  working with TF-DF were: (1) I was able to train a GradientBoostedTrees model with only a few lines of code; (2) there were lots of different default hyper-parameter options that I could choose from; (3) it was easy to visualize the structure/architecture of my models; and (4) it was easy to explore what features were most important to my model (to interpret and explain its decisions).\n\n\nWe worked with the [Tabular Playground Series May 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-may-2022/data) Kaggle Dataset.  It was a tabular dataset with 900,000 rows and 33 columns that contained data from industrial sensors, designed t be used to determine whether that piece of industrial equipment was in a state of  \"0\" or \"1\".\n\nWe were able to solve this task with an accuracy of ~85% which is not a bad baseline result given how quickly we were able to put this together (and with so few lines of code).\n\nTo learn more about TF-DF visit https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests.\n\nNext steps?\n - Click on the \"copy & edit\" button in the top right corner of this notebook\n - Experiment and try to increase the score.  My recommendation would be to focus on the [feature engineering and feature selection](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering) steps, as these steps were omitted from this tutorial (for the sake of brevity)\n - Make a submission to https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-may-2022","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"References:\n - https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tutorials/beginner_colab\n - https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tutorials/intermediate_colab\n - https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tutorials/advanced_colab","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
