An asset is what you would purchase if you want to invest in a company.<br>\nThis profit is what we call **returns**.<br>\nBut what if the company whose stocks you have purchased goes bankrupt?<br>\nThis will lead to its stocks crashing in the share market and instead of gaining profits, you will also lose your capital investment.<br>\nThis is what is called **risk** of investment.\n4. <font color='orange'>**Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**</font>\nModern Portfolio Theory, or also known as mean-variance analysis is a mathematical process which allows the user to maximize returns for a given risk level.\n5. <font color='red'>What is Efficient Frontier?</font>\nEfficient frontier is a graph with ‘returns’ on the Y-axis and ‘volatility’ on the X-axis. It shows the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given risk level or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.<br>\nPortfolios that lie outside the efficient frontier are sub-optimal because they do not provide either enough return for the level of risk or have a higher risk for the defined rate of return.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In each of these cases, the task of optimizing assets involves balancing the trade-offs between risk and return, where return on a stock is
