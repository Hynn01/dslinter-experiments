The first plot shows that apart from late 2019, the S&P 500 index value has a positive trend over time.\n\nThe second plot shows the effect of holidays on the data. We can see that for all but two of the holidays it seems that the value increases. It is important to note that the stock market closes on major holidays, and therefore the effect of these events may be reflected by the market on the days before and after the event.\n\nThe third plot shows that there is very little difference between each weekday in terms of how it affects the S&P 500 index value. Note that trades are not done on Saturday or Sunday so these values do not give us any additional information.\n\nFinally, we can see that the model sees a downward trend from February to March, whereas the other months are when the index value increases.

It is very fast, powerful, easy to implement, and highly customizable. I would say that it is my favorite forecasting framework as of this writing.\n\nThere are many components in the framework that I did not showcase in this article. These include adding additional regressors, providing custom changepoints, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning. \n\nIn this article, I made predictions solely on past S&P index values. I believe that even more predictive power could be unleashed using other data (current events, volatility, lending rates, etc.). This could be done through model blending with an LGBM/XGB regressor, and a tuned prophet-based model. \n\nI enjoy learning with hands-on examples and putting ideas into my own words. Hopefully, this article can motivate others to do the same!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### References\n\n1. https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-020-00333-6\n\n2. https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/strategy/what-you-need-know-about-seasonal-stock-trends/\n","metadata":{}}]}
