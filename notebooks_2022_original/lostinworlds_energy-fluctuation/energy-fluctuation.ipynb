Every sector of the economy has been impacted with governments placing major [targets to curb CO2 emissions](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/net-zero-strategy). The one key sources of CO2 emissions has been from energy usage. As industries seek alternative carbon neutral energy sources, in this project the CO2 emissions form specific energy sectors will be investigated. \n\n\nProvided by the [Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GN), the dataset reviewed in this project has records covering approx. 50 years from 1970 to 2019.  It holds a breakdown of CO2 emissions for a number of energy sectors from a myriad of countries. As it will become apparent, CO2 emissions from energy industries fluctuates over time and country to country. It is also notable that the energy types used in the fishing sector are particularly polluting. Moreover, the energy reliance differ from nation to nation and therefore the CO2 emissions from such sectors also vary. \n\nThis project will evaluate the data at a global level and shift its attention to two groups of nations G7 and South American nations to understand the variations in CO2 emissions. \n\n### G7\nG7 consists of some of the wealthiest countries in the world. As such, the populations in these nations are likely to have the biggest demand for energy through the use of luxury and leisure items. On the other hand, the wealth in these nations are likely to enable energy industries to invest in more effective methods of producing energy. Therefore the industries may be able to keep CO2 emissions low.\n\n\n### South American\nJuxtaposing the G7 are the South American countries. They have developing economies and are also in the southern hemisphere. Therefore, these countries are likely to have differing energy needs.\nIn the final section, limitations of this dataset are explored. The data has several weaknesses which affect the conclusions which can be drawn.\n\n## Overview\nThe dataset requires some data progressing. For further details on this, please refer to the appendix. It should be noted that as the appendix will emphasis,  the data has some mathematical outliers which are persistent. Subsequently, the median average has been used though this project as it is less likely to be skewed by extreme outliers.  Furthermore, due to some null values, the data has been capped to include only data from 1971 to 2018, rather than the full scope of the data. \n\n\nFollowing these steps, the data is as follows: \n\n*Please note, as some platforms do not support interactive graphs, the coding provides both static and interactive graphs in some cases*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# for data handling\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# for static graphs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n \n# for interactive graphs\nimport plotly_express as px\n\n# for kaggle\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-06T18:41:21.287561Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"energy = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/z-unlocked-challenge-1-data-visualization/energy_use_data_11-29-2021.csv\")\n\n# Clean data - exclude unnecessary data and make minor alterations for improved readability\n\nx = [\"Year Code\", \"Domain Code\", \"Domain\", \"Element Code\", \"Element\", \"Item Code\", \"Flag\", ]\nenergy.drop( x, inplace = True, axis =1)\nenergy.drop( energy[energy[\"Flag Description\"]==\"Aggregate, may include official, semi-official, estimated or calculated data\"].index, inplace = True, axis =0)\nenergy.rename(columns = {\"Area\": \"Country\"}, inplace = True)\n\nenergy.drop( energy[energy[\"Year\"].isin([1970, 2019])].index, inplace = True, axis =0)\n\n\n#Transforming the dataset for use later in the project\nenergy[\"Country\"].replace(\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\", \"UK\", inplace= True)\nenergy[\"Country\"].replace(\"United States of America\", \"USA\", inplace= True)\n\n\nenergy.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Establish frequently used functions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Restructure the data by grouping variables \ndef restructure_data (Dataset, GroupbyVariable,Value):\n    Overview = Dataset.groupby(GroupbyVariable)[Value].median().reset_index()\n    return Overview","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Extracts a the earliest/ oldest data in the dataset \ndef extract_values(Dataset, function):\n    if function == \"min\":\n        return Dataset[Dataset[\"Year\"] == Dataset[\"Year\"].min()].reset_index()\n    elif function == \"max\":\n        return Dataset[Dataset[\"Year\"] == Dataset[\"Year\"].max()].reset_index()\n    else:\n        print(\"incorrect function\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Compares the oldest/latest data against one another \ndef comparison_of_min_max(dataset):\n    Min = dataset[dataset[\"Year\"] == dataset[\"Year\"].min()]\n    Min = Min.groupby(\"Item\")[\"Value\"].median()\n\n    Max = dataset[dataset[\"Year\"] == dataset[\"Year\"].max()]\n    Max = Max.groupby(\"Item\")[\"Value\"].median()\n\n    Difference = Max-Min\n    Difference =Difference.reset_index().rename(columns = {\"index\": \"Item\", 0:\"Value\"}).fillna(0)\n    return Difference","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Extracts a cross section of the data based for specific country(s) \ndef extract_country_data (Country_list, Dataset):\n    extracted_data = Dataset[Dataset[\"Country\"].isin(Country_list)]\n    return extracted_data","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Global energy emissions\nBeginning at the global level, below is the average CO2 emissions from the energy sector.

Some of these limitations are outlined below.\n\n\nFirstly, the dataset does contain information on the changes in production. For instance, has there been any improvements in the production of one energy type over the other? As such, it cannot be concluded whether the CO2 decrease from 1970 to 2019 for “Gas-diesel oils used in fisheries” is due to decrease in demand/production or due to efficiencies in production.\n\n\nSecondly, due to the focus on CO2 emissions, the role of sustainable energy sectors such as wind and solar, and their role is unclear.\n\n\nThirdly, the calculations behind CO2 emission values are likely to have some limitations. Gas, for instance, needs to be burnt to produce the energy they hold. Therefore emitting additional CO2 after they have been produced. Electricity, on the other hand, does not emit further CO2 at the point of usage. Consequently, this dataset could damp down the level of pollution of some energy types.\n\n\nFurthermore, linked to the previous point is the extent of calculations. For example the machinery used to create such energy sources are likely to have CO2 emissions in its production. Likewise, transporting energy to the individuals needing it will also incur CO2 emissions. However it is unclear if these aspects have been included in this dataset.\n\n\nMoreover, CO2 is not the only negative aspect of the energy sector. Oil spillage and [acid rain](https://www3.epa.gov/acidrain/education/site_students/whatcauses.html#:~:text=Acid%20rain%20is%20caused%20by,pollutants%2C%20known%20as%20acid%20rain) are some aspects which are not captured in this dataset. This further emphasises that conclusions drawn from this dataset must be critically reviewed in the context of the wider discourse concerning climate change.\n\n\nElectricity can be produced through the use of fuel such as coal and Gas, i.e. energy listed separately in the dataset([Hausfather, 2019](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-the-uks-co2-emissions-have-fallen-38-since-1990)). Once again it is clear how this has been accounted for in the dataset.\nFinally as The Economist ([2011](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Economist-Economics-Making-Modern-Economy/dp/1846684595)) highlights even the GDP is known to have issues with accuracy especially in poorer nations. If this is to be expanded, it can be assumed that these figures may not be fully accurate regardless of the other issues highlighted above. Having said that, the ability to secure more accurate data is likely to face greater issues.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis has been an extensive examination of the global CO2 emissions for the energy sector for roughly a 50 year period. It highlights the fluctuations in CO2 overall as well as for specific energy industries. Energy centred upon fisheries is particularly polluting though its level of pollution appears to have decreased in the 2000s and onwards.\nIn addition, different countries recorded varying levels of CO2 emissions from different energy types.\nHowever due to a myriad of limitations with the data, further investigation is required to understand the cause of such fluctuations.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Understanding the dataset\nThis section will examine individual elements of the dataset and provide explanations concerning base assumptions made throughout the project.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data= pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/z-unlocked-challenge-1-data-visualization/energy_use_data_11-29-2021.csv\")\ndata.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On the surface, there does not appear to be any null values.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Domain, Element and Unit\nFirstly, the Domain Code\" and \"Domain\" contain only one variable, GN/Energy use.
