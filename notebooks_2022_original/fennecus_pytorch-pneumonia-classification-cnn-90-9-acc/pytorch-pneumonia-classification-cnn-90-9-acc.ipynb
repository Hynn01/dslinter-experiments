The infection leads to inflammation in the air sacs of the lungs, which are called alveoli. The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe. Symptoms can range from mild to serious and may include a cough with or without mucus (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing. How serious your pneumonia is depends on your age, your overall health, and what caused your infection. Both viral and bacterial pneumonia are contagious. \n\nTo diagnose pneumonia, your healthcare provider will review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and order diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray. \n\n![Pneumonia illustration](https://img.freepik.com/vector-gratis/saluda-e-insalubre-pulmones-humanos_1308-29197.jpg?t=st=1651922559~exp=1651923159~hmac=cc743ddf052394279d4437886c5661103454ddeca79a28b5261b3f1fe7c17603&w=996)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.2 Import libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os, random, itertools\n\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import metrics\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mlxtend.plotting import plot_confusion_matrix\n\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\nfrom torch import optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, WeightedRandomSampler\nimport torchvision.transforms as T\nimport torchvision","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T11:23:59.434432Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T11:23:59.435169Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T11:24:00.561415Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-07T11:23:59.435073Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-07T11:24:00.560691Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.3 Reproducibility\n**Reproducibility** in machine learning means that you can repeatedly run your algorithm on certain datasets and obtain the same (or similar) results on a particular project.

If we ignore this, we will lose \"real accuracy\". Why \"real accuracy\" instead of common accuracy? If the dataset is highly imbalanced, the model will get a pretty high accuracy just by predicting the majority class, but fail to capture the minority class. For example, the major class contains 99% of the objects and the minor only 1%. If the model always predict major class, the accuracy will be 99%. \n\nThere are some techniques for handling class imbalance.\n\nFirst is **undersampling**. In this technique, we randomly remove samples from the majority class until all the classes have the same number of samples. This technique has a significant disadvantage in that it discards data which might lead to a reduction in the number of representative samples in the dataset.\n\nNext is **oversampling**. In this technique, we try to make the distribution of all the classes equal in a mini-batch by sampling an equal number of samples from all the classes thereby sampling more examples from minority classes as compared to majority classes. Practically it is done by increasing the sampling probability of examples belonging to minority class thereby down-weighing the sampling probability of examples belonging to the majority class. \n\nIn **cost-sensitive learning**, the basic idea is to assign different costs to classes according to their distribution. There are various ways of implementing cost-sensitive learning like using higher learning rate for examples belonging to majority class as compared to examples belonging to minority class or using class weighted loss functions which calculate loss by taking the class distribution into account and hence penalize the classifier more for misclassifying examples from minority class as compared to majority class.\n\n(most information about this techniques was taken from [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/class-imbalance-d90f985c681e))\n\nOversampling and cost-sensitive learning showed the almost identical result, although the second was a little harder to implement and work with.
