[Bellabeat](https://bellabeat.com) is a successful small company based on art and technology, but focused only on women users in the global smart device market. [Urška Sršen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/urskasrsen/), Co-Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data . Then, using this information, and high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.\n\n# Requirements\n### Ask Phase\n\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage? \n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers? \n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy\n\n\n## Business tasks and metric goals\n\nIdentify potential opportunities for grow the business and recommendations for the Bellabeat marketing strategy improvement based on trends in smart device usage.\n\n\n# Preparing the data \n### Prepare Phase\n\n\n#### Datasets\nThis project will use the data provided by [Möbius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)  a Data Scientist at Healthcare area from Melbourne, Australia with [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).\nI will verify the trends in 24hrs scale so the datasets I'll use daily-based datasets as follows:\n\n| Table Name | Type | Description |\n| :--- | :-: | --------------- |\n| dailyActivity_merged | CSV File | Daily Activity over 31 days of 33 users. Tracking daily: Steps, Distance, Intensities, Calories |\n|dailyCalories_merged | CSV File | Daily Calories over 31  days of 33 users |\n| dailyIntensities_merged | CSV File | Daily Intensity over 31 days of 33 users. Measured in Minutes and Distance, dividing groups in 4 categories: Sedentary, Lightly Active, Fairly Active,Very Active |\n| dailySteps_merged | CSV File | Daily Steps over 31 days of 33 users | \n| sleepDay_merged | CSV File | Daily sleep logs, tracked by: Total count of sleeps a day, Total minutes, Total Time in Bed |\n| weightLogInfo_merged | CSV File | Weight track by day in Kg and Pounds over 30 days. Calculation of BMI.5 users report weight manually 3 users not.In total there are 8 users |\n* *Here in Kaggle we will use the direct addressing the datasets which is already sotred in here but I will exlain the normal procedure of doing my analysis in a local hard drive as well.*  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\n## The very first step\n\n\n### Naming convention\n\nWhen I downloaded the datasets I saw that they needed to be renamed, so the file name convention has been executed to the datasets by removing **\"_merged\"**, which was redundant and unifying the file names by separating words with an underscore alongside consistent lowercase letters.\n\n### Verifying the datasets in spreadsheets abd SQL\nImporting data in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) and pgAdmin4(an IDE for PostgreSQL), to have a quick look of what's inside of every datasets. After filtering and sorting some specific IDs and verifying the behavior of the data we are ready to dive deeper and have some quick analysis and visualizations. Since the data sets are not in large scales, so we can do all the analysis we want for this capstone in R Studio\n\n## Guiding questions\n\n* **Data location**\nThe data is securely saved in iCloud.\n* **Data organization**\nThe data is organized by month, each on a csv archives.\n* **Credibility and bias verification with ROCCC**\nThese datasets are released by it's own company, and for privacy security there is no name, address or financial information published in these datasets. However these datasets are not all recently distributed so they are no current for have the best analysis; also the quantity of participants is so low that make the bias margin range in a wide area. As a result this datasets aren't completely ROCCCs because however they're reliable, originally published by the manufacturer, comprehensive and cited but they are not current.\n* **Privacy, security, and accessibility**\nThe manufacturer company has the full rights to publish this data and license it for public analysis, also there is no personal information of any users in them. Also they are a text based data in CSV format which is not incluing any visual data.\n* **Data’s integrity**\nAll the files have consistent columns and each column has the correct type of data, although they are a third-party dataseys which means that data has been collected from outside resources who did not collect it directly.\n* **Data efficiency for business problem solving**\nThese datasets might have some key insights about the products usage data and improving the quality and usability of them which will end up to answer the [Business tasks and metric goals](##Business tasks and metric goals)\n* **Problems with the data**\nIt is necessary to constantly update these datasets to have the most recent information and help stakeholders to have the best data-driven decision makings. Also the quantity of participants must be in a wider range to have a lower bias margin.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So we have will begin the process by loading our packages in R.\n\n![](https://media.istockphoto.com/vectors/let-the-adventure-begin-beautiful-travel-and-adventure-quote-modern-vector-id1251656297?b=1&k=20&m=1251656297&s=612x612&w=0&h=TyA89e9kkdEToo_3gGA_d8gHJtjJxxo7qv_gaeVe458=)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(scales)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-30T20:17:42.98561Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-30T20:17:42.987473Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-30T20:17:43.011462Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we mentioned in the [Prepare Phase](### (Prepare Phase)), we are going to use the FitBit datasets provided by Möbius and we will import them in the platform to begin our analysis.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\ndaily_calories <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyCalories_merged.csv\")\ndaily_intensity <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv\")\ndaily_steps <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailySteps_merged.csv\")\ndaily_sleep <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\ndaily_weight <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-30T20:17:43.015512Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-30T20:17:43.017235Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-30T20:17:43.071645Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We already had a quick view on datasets in Google Sheets and SQL, but we need to be sure that the data has been imported properly, also to have a really nice and quick summary of our datasets which is the first thing we might need for having some ideas about where to begin our data-digging and visualizing the patterns.\nFirst let's see how many users participated in each category.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"n_distinct(daily_activity$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_calories$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_intensity$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_steps$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_sleep$Id)\nn_distinct(daily_weight$Id)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-30T20:17:43.106907Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-30T20:17:43.108824Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-30T20:17:43.162284Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There is 33 participants in the activity, calories and intensities datasets, 24 in the sleep and only 8 in the weight dataset. \nAs the recommendation the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in the field of probability and statistics the minimum recommended sample size is 30 since as sample size increases, the results more closely resemble the normal (bell-shaped) distribution from a large number of samples.

Bellabeat is a high-tech company with women health care mission since 2013, with the help of science and a great community of analysts, Bellabeat quickly defined its brand as a technological and data-driven healthcare company for women.  \n  This project focused on business tasks and to help Bellabeat on their mission which is improving women's health through great data analytics projects. Personally I prefer to gather and use my own tracking data for further analysis through multiple smart watches and other health-care gadgets.  \n  Also it is noticable that datasets that we used here has a small range of participants and is possible to be biased since we didn't have any details of users. Assuming that our main targets are young and adult women, it is highly recommended to search for more reliable datasets to have a consistant patterns and algorithms for having a correct business and marketing stragety.\n\n  During our project we have found some patterns that may answer the business tasks and improve **Bellabeat app** experience: \n\n| Recommendation | Description |\n|---| ---|\n|1. Motivational notifications on application and social media|We need to encourage users to reach at least daily recommended steps by CDC which is 10,000 to 12,000 for young females and 12,000 to 16,000 for young males by  **sending them notifications and motivational messages if they haven't reached the steps, calorie count or target distance** and **crefting social media or in-app contents for explaining the benefits of reaching the goals**.|\n|3. Sleep quality records| Based on our results we can see that many users doesn't have the sleep quality.. **We need to include setting time to go to sleep and receive a notification for cooldawn and being ready for bed to them to let them be prepared to go in bed**. |\n|2. Achievements league | Some people don't get motivated by notifications since they are so busy and focused in daily tasks, so we could create a achievement system or ranking system in the application with sharing capacity and create a challenge in social media based on it. **Rankings would consist in reaching higher levels based on amount of activity or exercise every user might have**. This might be the most important step that this company should take based on this analysis.|\n\n* *As there is no gender information about the participants, I assumed that all genders were presented and balanced in this data set.* \n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusions\n\n### Ideas and recommendations\n\n1. Activity dataset shows that average steps per day recorded by users are 7638 which is not enough for having health benefits according to the CDC research. We need to invent an achievement system or competition league for users to take more steps and distance per day.\n\n2. Categories for a health-care gadget is required to be extended by multiple sports categories and exercise recorders. We could offer to the technical and hardware engineer team to consider including gyroscope, altimeter, gps, barometer, body-temp sensor, heartbeat sensor, BP sensor and so on.\n\n3. The importance of sleep quality is not hidden for anyone these days, so Bellabeat can consider using sleep tracker sensor, snore sensor and advanced in-app notifications relevant to sleep quality, also offer helpfull resources for a better sleep quialty such as: breathing reminders, podcasts with relaxing music and meditation recommendations.\n\n4. In modern lifesyle most activities happens between 5:00 and 7:00 pm. Many people go to the gym or for a run or walk after finishing work. Bellabeat can use this period to remind and highly motivate users to begin their physical activity.\n\n5. Sedentary records are worrying in these datasets so the gyroscope and pedometer need to remind the user to have at least 5 minutes of walking around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://blog.fitbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/0328-self-control-blog-HERO.jpg)\n\nThis project by [Yousef Moterassed](https://www.kaggle.com/yousefmoterassed) and is dedicated for Bellabeat company's research team to have an analysis through FitBit users data and is available through Kaggle, GitHub, [my website](https://yousefmoterassed.wixsite.com/profile) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yousef-moterassed/).\n\n\nThank you for your time and I hope you enjoyed my case study analysis.  \n  With the best regards  \n  **Yousef Moterassed**  \n  🎫📱: [@persabras](http://instagram.com/persabras)","metadata":{}}]}
