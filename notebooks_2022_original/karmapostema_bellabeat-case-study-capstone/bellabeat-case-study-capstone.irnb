I have been asked to analyze the use of fitness tracker data to make recommendations on how BellaBeat can improve their technology and become a bigger player in the smart device global market. \n\n## Section 1: Ask Phase\n\n\n**Identify the business task**\n\nThe main objective of this business task is to analyze the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius) on kaggle to gain insight on how people currently use their fitness trackers. This will allow me, a newer analyst on the marketing team, to provide recommendations on how Bellabeat can improve their technology to meet the needs of their customers. \n\n**Consider key stakeholders**\n\nThe stakeholders are the co-founders Urška Sršen and Sando Mur. Both of which are key members of the executive team. They are accompanied by the Bellabeat marketing team. All stakeholders will be interested in a higher level analysis. For this reason I have chosen to focus on daily averages to complete my analysis. \n\n## Section 2: Prepare Phase\n\n\n**Download data and store it appropriately**\n\nThe data being used is stored on kaggle in  [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit] FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius). I started by downloading the .csv files and viewing them in excel to see what type of data I would be working with.\n\n**Identify how it’s organized**\n\nThe files are sorted into daily, hourly and minute usage. At this point I decided to focus on the daily files since I want to provide a high level   analysis utilizing average usage.\n\n**Does the data ROCCC?**\n\n-Reliable- The data does not specify that only women used the tracker. So although the data is relevant it does contain potential bias which could affect the results of the analysis. \n-Original- yes - data was gathered by monitoring 30 volunteers fit bit usage over the course of 2 months \n-Comprehensive- yes- data includes detailed information of how the fit bit users used the fitbit to track their progress\n-Current- no data was gathered between 3/12/2016 & 5/12/2016. The data will help identify usage but will not account for technology advances over the last few years.\n-Cited- yes\n\n\n**Sort and filter the data**\n\nNext I needed to decide how I wanted to sort and filter the data. I decided to use R because it will allow me to complete my analysis, including visuals in one place.\n\nHere you will see how I installed packages and uploaded the data into R so I could clean and process it for analysis. \n\n\n## Installing packages","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\") # -data cleaning and manipulation\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\") # -creating data visualizations \ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\") # -make the analysis reproducible \ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\") # -additional functions for analysis \ninstall.packages(\"lubridate\") # -manipulate date/time format\ninstall.packages(\"here\") # -creating file directory \ninstall.packages(\"skimr\") # -summarize data\ninstall.packages(\"janitor\") # -assist in data cleaning\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library (tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(janitor)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T13:12:59.59669Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T13:12:59.598644Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T13:13:01.098022Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Uploading data for analysis**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"activity <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv\")\nintensity <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv\")\nsleep <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv\")\nweight <- read.csv(\"../input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv\")\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T13:17:59.724688Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T13:17:59.726273Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T13:17:59.796417Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Checking to make sure everything uploaded correctly**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"head(activity)\nhead(intensity)\nhead(sleep)\nhead(weight)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T13:18:25.75093Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T13:18:25.752491Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T13:18:25.827176Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Section 3: Process Phase\n\n*Next I will check the validity of the data and clean it so I can use it for analysis*\n\n\n**Verifying the validity of the data** ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"activity %>% \n  count(Id, sort=TRUE)\nintensity %>% \n  count(Id, sort=TRUE)\nsleep %>% \n  count(Id, sort=TRUE)\nweight %>% \n  count(Id, sort=TRUE)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-07T13:18:43.99606Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-07T13:18:43.997805Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-07T13:18:44.160593Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*Based on entries by Id it seems as though the \"weight\" DF does not contain enough information to be included in this analysis.

BellaBeat could also add reminders to increase the number of steps taken in a day for their users*\n\n## Section 5: Act Phase\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the data that was provided for analysis I have identified the following opportunities:\n\n1) For the users that wore FitBit's to bed there is a positive correlation between the time they were in bed vs the time they were sleeping. I would expect that the goal would be to help this relationship become more linear. BellaBeat could improve their app by creating notifications for sleep, and rewarding users for getting enough rest. We could also expand our analysis to include data on how stress management impacts the restfulness of sleep. \n2) BellaBeat could also look into incorporating meditation, or stress management goals in the app and unlock new meditations everytime the user gets enough rest or hits a fitness goal. \n3) We looked at the relationship between calories burned and amount of time asleep, and many of the people who did get enough rest also burned the most calories. In addition to reminders to go to sleep, and adding meditation to the app, BellaBeat could also encourage users by issuing stars to rate their overall fitness. Users could earn stars as they get enough rest and earn bonuses when burning calories over goal. \n4) In our last visual we looked at the relationship between total steps taken and calories burned. Since there is a positive relationship BellaBeat could also add in step reminders. We could look into further health benefits by pulling additional datasets that compare step usage to overall health and provide fitness facts when users hit their step goals. An example being, “Congratulations on hitting your step goal! Users who hit their step goals burn more calories overall!” \n\n*This was my very first data analysis case study and I chose to complete it in R. Please let me know your thoughts on how I can grow my skills and improve this analysis*\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
