## Introduction

Public bike share (PBS).

A PBS is an extension of the existing transit system with a network of
short-term, self-service bicycle posts in which:

-   Users can use bikes by purchasing casual day use or annual
    memberships,

-   Users can ride bikes for a short distance for one-way trips within a
    defined service area and Station locations can change overtime based
    on ridership practices or operation needs.

Bike share technology continues to evolve quickly along with other
wireless and digital changes. Other recent advancements include systems
that do not require docking stations i.e. "smart lock" systems and
electric‚Äêassist bikes.

### About this dataset

I used 1 year (12 Months) of Divvy Chicago Bike Sharing Data from Mar
2021 to Feb 2022, obtained from Kaggle.com dataset .

This dataset included 5,667,986 trips, of which 3,127,293 / 55.2% were
made by annual or monthly members, and 2,540,693 / 44.8% by casual
users.

#### Missing features

Although this dataset is not a result of a survey, The following missing
features could make this analysis more interesting and stronger if were
exist.

-   Bike ID,
-   User ID,
-   User Gender,
-   User Age,
-   Purpose of trip,
-   Trip distance and
-   Weather conditions.

I believe some of them are connected to the agreed privacy policy!

Anyway, let's load the packages we need for this brief analysis

## Load libraries

```{r Load-libraries, include=FALSE}

library("tidyverse")
library("fs")
library("magrittr")
library("igraph")
library("lubridate")
library("vroom")
library("networkD3")
library("skimr")
library("janitor")
library("naniar")
library("scales")
library("glue")
library("patchwork")
library("knitr")
library("gghighlight")

theme_set(theme_light())

```

## Import data using map_dfr function from purrr package

```{r Import-data}

files_dir <- "../input/divvy-chicago-bikesharing-data/"
csv_files <- dir_ls(files_dir, regexp = "\\.csv$")
 divvy_trip_full_data <- csv_files %>% 
   map_dfr(read_csv) %>% # Import multiple files from the path 
  clean_names() # Clean the names and change them to Title case

dimentions <- dim(divvy_trip_full_data)

```

-   Number of observations = 5,667,986 and

-   Number of variables = 13.

To have a low computation; I will use 10% stratified sample of the
entire data, so The Findings may not be as they should be if I used the
full data.

## Take a stratified sample

```{r stratified-sample}

set.seed(27031967)
divvy_trip_full_data_sample <- divvy_trip_full_data %>%
  group_by(member_casual, rideable_type) %>%
  slice_sample(prop = 0.1) %>%
  ungroup()

rm(divvy_trip_full_data)
gc()


```

## Tidy data and create new features

```{r Tidy-data}



divvy_trip_full_data_sample <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>%
  mutate(across(.cols = c("member_casual", "rideable_type"), as.factor)) %>%
  mutate(
    trip_duration_sec = case_when(
      started_at < ended_at ~ interval(started_at, ended_at) %/% seconds(1),
      TRUE ~ interval(ended_at, started_at) %/% seconds(1)),
    trip_duration_details = duration(trip_duration_sec, "seconds")) %>%
  filter(trip_duration_sec > 30) # remove > 30 second duration

summary(divvy_trip_full_data_sample$trip_duration_sec)

glimpse(divvy_trip_full_data_sample)

```

***Observations:***

-   There are a lot of negative (-) duration! as the ended_at time was
    lower than the started_at in high numbers of observations, so I used
    if statement to calculate them! I do not know if I miss something
    obvious here!

-   I create a new variable (trip_duration_sec) and remove duration
    those less than 30 seconds!

-   The summary trip_duration_sec was as following:

    -   Min = 31 sec
    -   1st Qu. = 408 sec
    -   Median = 719 sec
    -   Mean = 1,294 sec
    -   3rd Qu. = 1,302 sec
    -   Max = 1,900,964 sec (\~3.14 weeks) !!! From 2021-06-02 20:19:45
        TO 2021-06-24 20:22:29

I think you can rent a bike for 3 weeks and then will be registered as
one record in the database, from point A to point B.

let us check how many records are more than 1 day (24 hours)

### Records are more than 1 day (24 hours) and more than 7 days (one week)

```{r Records-more-than-1-7-day}

# Records are more than 1 day (24 hours)

divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>% 
  select(trip_duration_sec) %>% 
  filter(trip_duration_sec > 86400) %>% 
  nrow()

# Records are more than 7 days (one week)

divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>% 
  select(trip_duration_sec) %>% 
  filter(trip_duration_sec > 604800) %>% 
  nrow()

```

***Observations:***

-   Records are more than one(1) day (24 hours) = 398 records

-   Records are more than seven(7) days (one week) = 35 records

### Trips duration Boxplot

```{r Trips-duration-Boxplot}

# I will use boxplot() function from base R

divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>% 
  pull(trip_duration_sec) %>% 
  log() %>% 
  boxplot(main = "Log of Trips duration",
          xlab = "log",medlty = 2,
          medlwd = 2,
          medpch = 22,
          medcex = 2,
          medcol = 2,
          medbg = 1,
          border = "darkred",
          horizontal = TRUE,
          frame = FALSE)

```

Better not to go deep into this issue especially, since I have no valid
information about Bike ID and User ID; I will consider them outliers!

OK, let's check the missing data.

### List of missing data

```{r missing-data}

skim(divvy_trip_full_data_sample) %>% 
  select(skim_variable, complete_rate) %>% 
  mutate(perct_missing = str_c(round(abs(complete_rate - 1),2),"%")) %>% 
  filter(perct_missing != "0%") %>% 
  kable()

```

#### Missing data intersections

```{r Missing-data-intersections}


missing_data_uoset_tbl <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>% 
  select( start_station_id,
         end_station_id)

gg_miss_upset(
  missing_data_uoset_tbl,
  main.bar.color = "#4c8c08",
  show.numbers = "yes",
  sets.bar.color = "#4c8c08",
  matrix.color = "#a00000",
  shade.color = "#4c8c08",
  order.by = "freq",
  point.size = 3,
  line.size = 0.75,
  shade.alpha = 0.2,
  text.scale = c(1.6, 1.3, 1, 1, 1.3, 1.3)
)


```

***Observations:***

We observed the following:

-   start_station_id, end_station_id intersected with 42472 records,

-   start_station_id has 27519 records and

-   end_station_name has 31850 records,

In some cases, we know the trip's start location and do not know the end
trip's end location or vice versa.

Once more, Bike ID and User ID can help to know better what is going on!

I think I will not stay here too long. I will handle that whenever I
need to!

## Key Findings

### Stations Number

```{r Stations-Number}

start_station_id <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>% 
  select(start_station_id) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  pull()

end_station_id <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>% 
  select(end_station_id) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  pull()


stations_id <- c(start_station_id, end_station_id) %>% 
  unique()

length(stations_id)

```

***Observations:***

-   In "divvy_trip_full_data_sample", We have 825 stations, however, in
    the full data "divvy_trip_full_data" we have 848 stations serving
    the area of the bike sharing system.

Let us find the Top 10 stations

### Top 10 start station id, start station name And Top 10 end station id, end station name

```{r Top-10-start-end-station}

top_10_start_station <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>%
  mutate(start_station_name = fct_lump(start_station_name, 10)) %>% 
  count(start_station_id, start_station_name, name = "counts", sort = T) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(start_station_name),
         !is.na(start_station_id),
         start_station_name != "Other") %>%
  mutate(start_station_name = fct_reorder(start_station_name, counts))

# plot

  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E", direction = -1) +
  labs(title = "Top 10 start station id and start station name",
       x = NULL,

top_10_end_station <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>%
  mutate(end_station_name = fct_lump(end_station_name, 10)) %>% 
  count(end_station_id, end_station_name, name = "counts", sort = T) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(end_station_name),
         !is.na(end_station_id),
         end_station_name != "Other") %>%
  mutate(end_station_name = fct_reorder(end_station_name, counts))

# plot

           width = 0.8,
           show.legend = FALSE) +

       caption = "Data Source: Kaggle | Divvy Chicago Bike Sharing Data",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)

top_10_start_plt / top_10_end_plt


# setdiff(top_10_start_station$start_station_name, top_10_end_station$end_station_name) 

# setdiff(top_10_end_station$end_station_name, top_10_start_station$start_station_name) 

```

***Observations:***

Top 3 start_station_name:

-   1st: "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave" is the most targeted station in both
    start_station_name and end_station_name.

-   2nd: "Michigan Ave & Oak St",

-   3rd: "Wells St & Concord Ln".


Top 3 end_station_name:

-   1st: "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave" is the most targeted station in both
    start_station_name and end_station_name.

-   2nd: "Michigan Ave & Oak St",

-   3rd: "Millennium Park".

#### 4th July, New year, Halloween and Christmas day plots

```{r 4th-July-New-year-Halloween-and-Christmas-day-plots, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}

fourth_july / New_year / Halloween / christmas_day +
  plot_annotation(title = "4th July, New year, Halloween and Christmas bikes usage plots") & 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

***Observations:***

-   Low bike usage during the holidays that majority of customers
    celebrate with families or friends (indoor) like New year and
    Christmas

-   High usage during the holidays the customers celebrate outdoor like
    4th July and Halloween.

Although there are always exceptions to the figures above, like the day
or night activities, these figures are realistic somehow, so companies
can think about how to benefit from them.

member_casual_col / member_casual_pie 

```

***Observations:***

-   Members and casual users show different usage patterns,

-   Casual users tend to use bikes during weekends more than during
    weekdays,

-   Members Users keep a realistic pattern that every member gets a
    membership for. that is to say, they already know their daily needs
    and plan.

rideable_type_col / rideable_type_pie

```

***Observations:***

-   Classic bike: The most used bikes are 58%. I believe most people
    feel comfortable with this kind of bike, and it seems designed for
    easy riding regardless of riding ability.

-   Electric bike: Second in the list with 37%.

-   Docked bike: 6%, YOY will phase out.

### Weekly Rides distribution by Types of rideables

```{r Weekly-Rides-distribution-by-Types-of-rideables , fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}

divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>%
  count(week = floor_date(started_at, "week"),
        rideable_type,
        name = "counts") %>%

       caption = "Data Source: Kaggle | Divvy Chicago Bike Sharing Data",
       x = "",
       y = "Counts")

```

***Recommendations:***

-   It is recommended to add more classic Bike to the operation as well
    as Electric bike.

-   Make an effective and gradual plan to phase out the docked bike.

### Weekday weekend rides by types of customers

weekday_weekend_member + weekday_weekend_casual

```

***Observations:***

Member Rides:

-   Weekday Rides = 74%

-   Weekend Rides = 26%

Casual Rides:

-   Weekday Rides = 59%

-   Weekend Rides = 41%

As we already know, Casual users rent bikes during the Weekends more
than members' users do!

***Recommendation:***

-   I would like to advise the company to have a particular membership
    plan for weekends if they do not have one already!

### Weekday VS Weekend Trips By Time Of Day

    y = "Counts",
    color = NULL
  )

```

***Observations:***

-   Bike usage fluctuates throughout the day, and
-   The majority of trips occurred between 6 am and 9 pm.

On weekdays, - Members and casual users show different travel patterns.
Members show commute activity (spikes in usage from 7:00 -- 9:00 and
17:00 -- 19:00), and constant usage throughout the day. - Casual usage
increased throughout the day with a constant peak from noon-7pm.

On the weekends, - Members and casual users exhibit similar behavior
with the daytime peak occurring between 2-4pm. - Casual users made a
higher proportion of mid-day trips.

### Daily rides (number of trips)

```{r Daily-rides-number-of-trips }

day_year <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>%

    x = "DaysYear",
    y = "Counts",
    caption = "Data Source: Kaggle | Divvy Chicago Bike Sharing Data",
    color = NULL
  )

```

***Observations:***

-   The line spikes are the high usage of bikes, mainly on Sat and Sun, and
    on some weekends the bike usage dropped; I think it is the Holidays.

-   The usage in summer time is above the average (the green dashed
    line)

### Rides seasonal distribution

This image does not need explanations:

-   Weather conditions factor,

-   Tourists,

-   Outing,

-   Enjoying Summertime and

-   Of course, Routine WORK

## Network analysis

### Sankey Network

```{r Sankey-Network , fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}


stations_link <- divvy_trip_full_data_sample %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  select(start_station_id,
         start_station_name,
         end_station_id,
         end_station_name) %>%
  mutate(same_direction = ifelse(start_station_id == end_station_id, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  filter(ifelse(start_station_id == end_station_id, TRUE, FALSE) == FALSE) %>%
  count(start_station_name,
        end_station_name,
        sort = T,
        name = "counts") %>%
  filter(counts > 135) %>%
  as.data.frame()


nodes_df <-
  data.frame(
    station_name = c(
      stations_link$start_station_name,
      stations_link$end_station_name
    ) %>%
      unique()
  ) 


stations_link <- stations_link %>%
  mutate(
    source_id = match(start_station_name, nodes_df$station_name) - 1,
    target_id = match(end_station_name, nodes_df$station_name) - 1
  )


my_color <- 'd3.scaleOrdinal().range(["#555511","#002164","#ffff00","#6b3500","#80b700","#ffbf00","#f0ad00","#fa8400","#002164","#ea4c89","#1f4a53"])'

sankeyNetwork(
  Links = stations_link,
  Nodes = nodes_df,
  Source = "source_id",
  Target = "target_id",
  Value = "counts",
  NodeID = "station_name",
  sinksRight = T,
  nodeWidth = 20,
  fontSize = 12,
  colourScale = my_color,
  nodePadding = 3
)


```

***Observations:***

-   "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave" is the most targeted station in both
    start_station_name and end_station_name.

-   Ellis Ave & 60th St is the 2nd

-   "Michigan Ave & Oak St" is the 3nd.

For example, and according to this data sample, if your destination is
"Theater on the Lake" coming from "Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St" you can go
through three(3) Stations:

-   "Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St" --\> "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave" --\>
    "Michigan Ave & Oak St" --\> "Theater on the Lake"

OR Two(2) stations:

-   Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St" --\> "Streeter Dr & Grand Ave" --\>
    "Theater on the Lake"

### Vertex Network

```{r Vertex-Network, fig.height=20, fig.width=30}

net <- stations_link %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  filter(counts > 100) %>%
  graph.data.frame(directed = T)

set.seed(0)
plot(
  net,
  edge.arrow.size = 2,
  edge.color = "darkred",
  edge.width = 1,
  edge.curved = .1,
  vertex.shape = "circle",
  vertex.size = 7,
  vertex.color = "darkgreen",
  vertex.frame.color = "black",
  vertex.label = V(net)$names,
  vertex.label.color = "black",
  vertex.label.dist	= -1,
  vertex.label.cex	= 1.7
)

 
```

It is crowded somehow and needs more adjustment, we may play with
set.seed to have a proper one or subset the data according to the
analysis we need.

These Sankey Network and Vertex Network can explain a lot of more things
like:

-   One(1) way Trips,

-   Round Trips,

-   Congested streets Or stations

## Further analysis we may do:

-   Arrival and Departure,

-   Members and casual locations on Map,

-   Number of Trips moving average,

-   More...

## Final Note

As I mentioned in the introduction, Missing features such as Bike ID,
USER ID, Gender, and age, else, could definitely make this analysis
more interesting and stronger if were exist.

### Good to Know

Using a bike for transport is highly recommended, on top of everything
else,

-   Saving transport costs,

-   Burning thousands of calories,

-   Reducing the probability of having Heart and vesicular disease and

-   Road traffic stress leading to depression while seating in
    wheel-metallic-box we proudly call it CAR!

Your comments are highly appreciated.

Thank you for reading and Supporting and LET'S HAVE A BIKE!.
