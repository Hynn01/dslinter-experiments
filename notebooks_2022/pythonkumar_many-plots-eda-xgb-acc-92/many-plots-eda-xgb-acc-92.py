# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# **From the EDAs the following can be observed :-**
# 1. All Features are numeric - no need of Label Encoding
# 2. All Features are Normally Distributed & Unimodal - no need of Log / Box-Cox Transformations
# 3. Boxplot reveals presence of some Minor Outliers - we may be FINE including these, but I choose to get rid of these for sake of accuracy

# # Removing Outliers
# 
# In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set. An outlier can cause serious problems in statistical analyses.

# # Train Test Split

# It splits the train data into 4 parts, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test.

# * X_train, y_train first used to train the algorithm.
# * X_test is used in that trained algorithms to predict outcomes.
# * Once we get the outcomes, we compare it with y_test
