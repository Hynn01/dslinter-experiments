# >### PurgedGroupTimeSeries CV - NN
# >This is a simple starter notebook for Kaggle's JPX Comp showing purged-group-timeseries KFold. Purged Times Series is explained [here][1]. There are many configuration variables below to allow you to experiment. Use either CPU or GPU. You can control which years are loaded, which neural networks are used, and whether to use feature engineering. You can experiment with different data preprocessing, model hyperparameters, loss, and number of seeds to ensemble.
# >
# >**NOTE:** this notebook lets you run a different experiment in each fold if you want to run lots of experiments. (Then it is like running multiple holdout validation experiments but in that case note that the overall CV score is meaningless because LB will be much different when the multiple experiments are ensembled to predict test). **If you want a proper CV with a reliable overall CV score you need to choose the same configuration for each fold.**

# 
# In order to use proper cross validation with a meaningful overall CV score, **you need to choose the same** `DEPTH_NETS`, `WIDTH_NETS` **for each fold**. If your goal is to just run lots of experiments, then you can choose to have a different experiment in each fold. Then each fold is like a holdout validation experiment. When you find a configuration you like, you can use that configuration for all folds.
# * DEVICE - is GPU or TPU
# * SEED - a different seed produces a different triple stratified kfold split.
# * FOLDS - number of folds. Best set to 3, 5, or 15 but can be any number between 2 and 15
# * INC2022 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2022.
# * INC2021 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2021.
# * INC2020 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2020.
# * INC2019 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2019.
# * INC2018 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2018.
# * INC2017 - This controls whether to include the extra historical prices during 2017.
# * INCSUPP - This controls whether to include the supplemented train data that was released with the competition.
# * BATCH_SIZES - is a list of length FOLDS. These are batch sizes for each fold. For maximum speed, it is best to use the largest batch size your GPU or TPU allows.
# * EPOCHS - is a list of length FOLDS. These are maximum epochs. Note that each fold, the best epoch model is saved and used. So if epochs is too large, it won't matter.
# * DEPTH_NETS - is a list of length FOLDS. These are the Network Depths to use each fold. The number refers to the number of layers. So a number of `1` refers to 1 layer, and `2` refers to 2 layers, etc.
# * WIDTH_NETS - is a list of length FOLDS. These are the Network Widths to use each fold. The number refers to the number of units per layer. So a number of `32` refers to 32 per layer, and `643` refers to 64 layers, etc.

# # Time Series Cross Validation
# 
# > "There are many different ways one can do cross-validation, and **it is the most critical step when building a good machine learning model** which is generalizable when it comes to unseen data."
# -- **Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem**, by Abhishek Thakur
# 
# CV is the **first** step, but very few notebooks are talking about this. Here we look at "purged rolling time series CV" and actually apply it in hyperparameter tuning for a basic estimator. This notebook owes a debt of gratitude to the notebook ["Found the Holy Grail GroupTimeSeriesSplit"](https://www.kaggle.com/jorijnsmit/found-the-holy-grail-grouptimeseriessplit). That notebook is excellent and this solution is an extention of the quoted pending sklearn estimator. I modify that estimator to make it more suitable for the task at hand in this competition. The changes are
# 
# - you can specify a **gap** between each train and validation split. This is important because even though the **group** aspect keeps whole days together, we suspect that the anonymized features have some kind of lag or window calculations in them (which would be standard for financial features). By introducing a gap, we mitigate the risk that we leak information from train into validation
# - we can specify the size of the train and validation splits in terms of **number of days**. The ability to specify a validation set size is new and the the ability to specify days, as opposed to samples, is new.
# 
# The code for `PurgedTimeSeriesSplit` is below. I've hidden it because it is really meant to act as an imported class. If you want to see the code and copy for your work, click on the "Code" box.

class GroupTimeSeriesSplit(_BaseKFold):
    """Time Series cross-validator variant with non-overlapping groups.
    Provides train/test indices to split time series data samples
    that are observed at fixed time intervals according to a
    third-party provided group.
    In each split, test indices must be higher than before, and thus shuffling
    in cross validator is inappropriate.
    This cross-validation object is a variation of :class:`KFold`.
    In the kth split, it returns first k folds as train set and the
    (k+1)th fold as test set.
    The same group will not appear in two different folds (the number of
    distinct groups has to be at least equal to the number of folds).

    training sets are supersets of those that come before them.

# Our model will be trained for the number of FOLDS and EPOCHS you chose in the configuration above. Each fold the model with lowest validation loss will be saved and used to predict OOF and test. Adjust the variable `VERBOSE`. The variable `VERBOSE=1 or 2` will display the training and validation loss for each epoch as text.
