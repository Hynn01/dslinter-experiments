We have seen the below plots and how they can be created. This can a good source of learning Tidyverse and R. \n\n1. A histogram - the most basic chart that you get to know first in ggplot. \n1. A density plot - the aesthetics of this chart looks very pretty and gives a pretty visualization\n1. A Bump Chart - A very unique chart that can show how variables have changed over a period of time for a few categories\n1. A Stacked Bar Chart - This is a complicated but very important chart type. It conveys a lot of information in one single plot\n1. A ridge chart - Another stratified way of looking at a density plot. Good for visualizing another set of categorical variables\n1. A Dumbbell Chart - The most beautiful of them all I believe. It shows the range of an observation for a particular set of categories. It helps to undertand the deviations, range etc. \n\n\nIn addition to the above technicalities we also learned how we can pick up a data set and perform a basic level of EDA on it. EDAs keep on continuing. We learn a few aspects from a set of EDA, we get answers to a few questions, the plots give rise to further questions and we pick a small interesting area and do a deep dive into it to find out more interesting facts. \n\nThanks all .. for reading up to this.
