Only 24 users had sleep data. Bellabeat should focus on promoting how comfortable their fitness device really is, while also promoting the longevity of the battery life.\n\n- User are mostly active during their lunchbreak from 12-2pm & after work from 5-7pm. They are less active from 10pm-7am where they have to sleep and rest for the next day of work.\n\n- The datasets used have a small sample and can be biased since we didn’t have any demographic details of users.\n\n- Knowing that our main target are young and adult women I would encourage to continue finding trends to be able to create a marketing strategy focused on them.\n\n#### Recommendations\nWhile promoting overall wellness, Bellabeat should focus on  promoting regular workouts or regular walks to burn calories to compensate non active moments.\n\nBellabeat’s app can include workout ideas to help users who may want to stick to a tailored routine to stay fit.\n\nFinally, Bellabeat can isntitute a reward system for its users. We can put in place a reward system where users can get reward for reaching a certain daily number of steps or calories burnt at the end of the year. This can be used as reward points to subsidize membership fees.\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
