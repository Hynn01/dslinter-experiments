Travel Assured is a travel insurance company. Due to the COVID pandemic, they have had to cut their marketing budget by over 50%. It is more important than ever that they advertise in the right places and to the right people.\n\nTravel Assured has plenty of data on their current customers as well as people who got quotes but never bought insurance. They want to know if there are differences in the travel habits between customers and non-customers - they believe they are more likely to travel often (buying tickets from frequent flyer miles) and travel abroad. Our business task is to uncover any insights from these data that might help the marketing strategy.\n\n\n**ASK**\n\nFrom our business task, we can ask the following questions:\n\n* What are the differences in the travel habits between customers and non-customers?\n\n* How can these travel habits be turned into marketing opportunities?\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**PREPARE**\n\nSince the data set for our project was provided by a primary data source: Travel Assured, we are assured that the data is reliable.
