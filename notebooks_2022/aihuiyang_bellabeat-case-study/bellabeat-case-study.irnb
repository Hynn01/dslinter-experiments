Bellabeat can add on more features to help users fall asleep and improve sleep quality. \n* The positive relationship between calories burned and time to fall asleep indicates that a certain amount of exercise improves sleep quality. Bellabeat can inform its users of this tip in many ways to encourage them to be more active.  \n* During 5-7 pm, people burn the most calories and walk moat steps, followed by 12-2 pm. It might indicate that most people like to exercise after work or during their lunch break. To help them establish and retain healthy habits, the Bellabeat can send reminders to encourage its users to do more exercise.  \n* BMI information varies.
