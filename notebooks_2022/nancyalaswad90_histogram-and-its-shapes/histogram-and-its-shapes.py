# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

# ## Histogram and its Shapes 😊

# 
# 
# ================================
# 
# 
# 
# > **Let's Work hard  🧐 and study Histogram and its Shapes**
# 
# .
# 
# Our topic today will be about  (( [The Shape Of Histogram](https://www.statology.org/describe-shape-of-histogram/) ))  , I would like to share with you useful resource that make concept more easy :woman_student:

# 
# 
# 
# > Let’s say the main idea for **`Histogram and its Shapes`**  is to  allows us to visualize the distribution of values in a dataset as shown in the image below: -
# 
# 
# 
# 
# .
# 
# 
# So, at the beginning we need to understand the following ideas  : -
# 
# =====================================================
# 
# - The `x-axis`  displays the values in the dataset and the `y-axis` shows the frequency of each value.
# 
# 
# - Depending on the `values in the dataset`, a histogram can take on many different shapes.
