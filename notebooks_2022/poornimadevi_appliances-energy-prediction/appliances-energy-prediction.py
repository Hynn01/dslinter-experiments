# # Some questions I am trying to answer: 
# * How much energy is consumed in indoor and outdoor appliances?
# * what is the coerration of humidity and temperature in indoor and outdoor environment?
# * Does the environment of sensor affects the way enegry is consumed by appliances?
# * Identify the appliances with low efficiency in home (which room)
# * relationship between appliances and light
# * How weather is coerrated with the energy consumption in homes and why this study is important? 

# # Introduction:
# 
# The data set is at 10 min for about 4.5 months. The house temperature and humidity conditions were monitored with a ZigBee wireless sensor network. Each wireless node transmitted the temperature and humidity conditions around 3.3 min. Then, the wireless data was averaged for 10 minutes periods. The energy data was logged every 10 minutes with m-bus energy meters. Weather from the nearest airport weather station (Chievres Airport, Belgium) was downloaded from a public data set from Reliable Prognosis (rp5.ru), and merged together with the experimental data sets using the date and time column. Two random variables have been included in the data set for testing the regression models and to filter out non predictive attributes (parameters).
