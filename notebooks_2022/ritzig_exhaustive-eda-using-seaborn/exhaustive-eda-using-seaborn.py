# # EDA USING SEABORN
# 
# This notebook attempts to carry out an exhaustive EDA with beginner friendly tutorial using SEABORN . This notebook is still in progress and further feature engineering , model building will be added to this eventually !
# So let's hop on and explore the Spaceship Titanic Dataset!! 

# # DATA FIELD DESCRIPTION
# train.csv - Personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.
# 
# * PassengerId - A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always.
# * HomePlanet - The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
# * CryoSleep - Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins.
# * Cabin - The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard.
# * Destination - The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
# * Age - The age of the passenger.
# * VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
# * RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities.
# * Name - The first and last names of the passenger.
# * Transported - Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict.

# # Quick EDA
# 
# A quick eda can be carried out using pandas, we can observe the following - 
# 
# 
# > * **Transported** - Almost half or majority of the passengers are transported to another dimensions i.e. value True <br>
# * **HomePlanet** -  The passengers come from 3 unique homeplanets. Majority of them come from *Earth* ðŸ˜‡
# * **CryoSleep** - Almost 60% of passengers prefer to travel without cryosleep . Note passengers who are in cryosleep are confined to cabins.
# * **Destination** - 3 unique destinations and 70% are travelling to *TRAPPIST-1e*	 planet :)
# * **Age** - Mean age of passengers 29 and median age 27 . Slightly right skewed. Highest age being 79 and min age is 0 . 25% of pasenngers age below 19 . 
# * **VIP** - 95% of passengers are non-VIP .
# * **Services** -  Out of all services average amount spend is highest for Food Court. Since food being a necessity .

# # Adding Columns / Splitting Columns 
# 
# Based on Data field description we can split the column `PassengerId` and `Cabin`  to derive further feature columns for analysis.
# 
# * `PassengerId` split into :
#   * `Group_Num` 
#   * `Group_Id`
# 
# * `Cabin` split into:
#   * `deck`
#   * `num`
#   * `side`

# # Univariate Analysis
# 
# 
# * AGE - We see a high count of age near 0 bin followed by a dip and then another rise.
# * TOTALBILL - Majority 50% of total bill near 0,median slightly above 0 . Lot of outliers present
# * DECK - deck F,G having majority of passengers, deck T and A having minimum.
# * SIDE - Almost equal number of passengers for both sides.

# **RUG PLOT**
# 
# A rug plot is a plot of data for a single quantitative variable, displayed as marks along an axis. It is used to visualise the distribution of the data. As such it is analogous to a histogram with zero-width bins, or a one-dimensional scatter plot.

# # Bivariate Analysis
# 
# We now go through analysing relationship between 2 variables. 
# 
# * AGE vs Transported  - age in 0-10 have higher number of transported passengers as compared to non-transported.
# * TotalBill vs AGE - Passengers with age less than 13 years have 0 total bill. 
# * HomePlanet vs Transported - Passengers from "Europa" planet has highest prob of getting transported ~0.7
# * CryoSleep vs Transported - Passengers in Cryosleep i.e. True have 0.8 prob of getting transported.
# * Destination vs Transported - Cancrei 55 e has 0.6 prob highest followed by others at 0.5 .
# * Deck vs Transported  - Deck B, C passengers have highest prob ~0.7 of getting transported.
# * VIP vs Transported  - Non- VIP passengers have higher prob of getting transported >0.5.
# * Side vs Transported - 's' side passengers have higher prob of getting transported >0.5
# 
# * TotalBill vs VIP - On an average VIP passengers have higher bill amount
# 
# * TotalBill vs Deck - ODeck B and C having high bill amounts as compared to other decks
# * Cryosleep vs Deck - The prob of being put on cryosleep is high for deck B and G and if we recall prob of crysleep being transported is high and same can be observed when we see deck wise prob of being transported we see Deck B,C ,g having high prob so a connection between deck, cryosleep and transported there.
