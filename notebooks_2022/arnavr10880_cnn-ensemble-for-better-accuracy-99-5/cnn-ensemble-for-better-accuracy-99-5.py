#     
# MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto ‚Äúhello world‚Äù dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike. 
#     
# In this notebook, Modified LeNet CNN along with ensembling will be used to predict the digits.

# 
# > `from collections import Counter`
# >

# > 
# > `print(Counter(a))`

#     <th>pixel1</th>
#     <th>...</th>
#     <th>pixel785</th>
#   </tr>
# </table>
#     
# From the shape of the train dataframe, total columns are 42000 x 785. The image size that is required is 28 x 28 which means the source should have 784 dimensions. As train set has 785 dimensions including the **label** column, hence **label** needs to be seperated from the training set so that the remaining columns can be reshaped into the required 28 x 28 size.

# Normalizing the pixel values is a necessary step. There may be pixels representing the values say **244** while there may be some having the value **2**, so passing them as it is to a machine learning or deep learning algorithm will make the models perform poorly as there are some values enormously larger than the others. It creates an uneveness among the values. Also, it also messes with our beloved **gradient descent**. üôÇ <br/>

# ### <b><span style="color:#27aee3; font-weight:1200">‚Äª</span> One-hot encoding & Validation Set
#     
# 
# One-hot encoding is a process by which categorical targets are converted to a binary form (1's & 0's). The best way to understand is using an example. Suppose like in this set, there are 10 classes, each number representing the equivalent digit:
# 
# <h3 align='center'> [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ] </h3>
#     
# Now, once one-hot encoding is done using tensorflow, the result can be interpreted in the following way:
#     
# <b>Image at index 3</b>
# 
# <code>plt.imshow(x_train[3])</code>
#     
# which is the digit <b> 4 </b> (look in the coming cells). Now, to check the <code>y_train</code> for the answer, the result is as shown below:
# 
# <code>y_train[3]</code>
#     
# > $ \begin{bmatrix}
# 0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.  \\
# \end{bmatrix}  $
#     
# Here, 0 means the digit is not present at this index while 1 means the digit is present at this index (which in this case is it's value). So, the above result means that the value is at index **4** which in this case is it's value.
#     
# Well, this may take a little time to wrap the head around :)

# ### <b><span style="color:#27aee3; font-weight:1200">‚Äª</span> How CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) works?<br/>
# 
# <center><img width=600 height=600 src='https://www.mdpi.com/entropy/entropy-19-00242/article_deploy/html/images/entropy-19-00242-g001.png'></img></center>
# <br/>
# 
# In mathematics, convolution is the operation of two functions to produce a third
# modified function. In the context of CNNs, the first function is the input image, and
# the second function is the convolutional filter. Some mathematical
# operations are performed to produce a modified image with new pixel values.
# The above image summarizes the whole process of a CNN.
# 
# The basic components of a CNN involves:
# - CONV layer
# - POOLING layer
# - FULLY CONNECTED layer
# 
# 
# 
# #### <b><span style="color:#27aee3; font-weight:1200">‚Äª</span> CONV Layer<br/>
# 
# - The image pixel values are passed to the 1st convolutional layer of a CNN;
# - All the Convolutional layers try to find the relations between the pixels and their neighborhood pixels (with the help of kernels) and extract the different features of the image;
# - Then, the result is passed on to the subsequent layers (the kernel works like below):
# 
# <center><img height=700 width=700 src='https://1.cms.s81c.com/sites/default/files/2021-01-06/ICLH_Diagram_Batch_02_17A-ConvolutionalNeuralNetworks-WHITEBG.png'></img></center><br/>
# 
# 
# 
# #### <b><span style="color:#27aee3; font-weight:1200">‚Äª</span> POOLING Layer<br/>
# 
# - Adding more convolutional layers increases the depth of the output layer, which leads to increase in the number of parameters that the network needs to optimize (learn). This in turn increases the dimensions and hence training may become computationally expensive. So, pooling helps reduce the size of the network by reducing the number of parameters passed to the next layer.
# 
# <center><img height=500 width=500 src='https://cs231n.github.io/assets/cnn/maxpool.jpeg'></img></center>
# <br/>
# 
#

# #### <b><span style="color:#27aee3; font-weight:1200">‚Äª</span> FULLY CONNECTED Layer<br/>
#     
# <center><img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/441/1*yjy3dwRL-vmSpmUG7UNJYg@2x.png'></img></center>  
#   
# - Finally, after passing the image through the feature-learning process using convolutional and pooling layers, all the features are extracted and are put in a long tube. Hence, the extracted features are ready to be used for classification with the help of the usual fully connected layers.

# - The 5x5 layers are replaced by two 3x3 layers for better feature extraction;
# - BatchNormalization is added;
# - The pooling layers are replaced by convolutional layers of stride 2;
# - **sigmoid** activation is replaced by **relu** one;
# - Dropout is added; 
# - The network is made more deeper; and
# - Ensembling of the CNN's is done.
