Import dataset\n1. Exploratory Data Analysis\n  - distributions\n  - anything else that is interesting?\n1. Which playing style is most popular? Least popular?\n\nAs a table tennis player myself, my ulterior motive is to see which playing style I should try to give my opponents the most headaches. Read this as: least common/rare playing styles.\n\n## Import\n\nHere, I start off by importing the necessary packages and dataset. Note: KF.QoL is a custom package I wrote that contains custom functions I wrote to improve my coding/analysis quality of life.\n\n### Packages + Functions\n\n```{r}\n#Core packages/functions\ngc()\nlibrary(KF.QoL)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(data.table)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n#Additional packages\nlibrary(bslib)\n```\n\n## Player Info Dataset\n\n```{r}\nplayer_info <- KF.QoL::soleImport(\"~/Desktop/KaggleData/ITTF/ittf_player_info.csv\",fread=TRUE)\n```\n\n### EDA\n\nWhen taking a first look at the data, I notice some players have \"-\" for one or more of the following:\n\n1. Playing hand\n1. Playing style\n1. Grip\n\nAs such, I want to take a closer look at the type of missingness this is. To simplify things, I am filtering for the rows I am interested in (have \"-\" in at least 1 of the 3 listed variables).\n\n```{r}\ninfo_temp <- player_info %>% filter(`Playing hand`==\"-\"|`Playing style`==\"-\"|`Grip`==\"-\")\n```\n\nThe number of rows went from `r nrow(player_info)` to `r nrow(info_temp)`.\n\n```{r}\n#go over all vars (except Player ID & Name) to print out unique values\nnumLvls <- lapply(names(info_temp)[-(1:2)],function(x){\n  (unique(info_temp[[x]]))\n})\n\n#add names (to avoid any confusions)\nnames(numLvls) <- names(info_temp)[-(1:2)]\n```\n\nFrom this result, I all aspects of the player's style is unknown. A large number:\n\n`r unique(numLvls[[\"Assoc\"]])` \n\nof Associations are represented. Males and Females are represented. A wide range of birth years are represented. But, there is at least one instance of NA and \"0\". Players that are `r unique(numLvls[[\"Activity\"]])` are represented.\n\n#### Questions I have (for this subset of data):\n\n- What is the difference between \"-\" and NA for the player's style? Are they the same?\n- What does \"^^\" next to name mean?\n  - How many have that?\n- Which years are not represented here?\n  - Is it due to players not being born on that year?\n  - Or is there a hidden correlation?\n- What is distribution on: gender, association, activity\n\n#### Plotting Distributions\n\n```{r}\n#list of vars I want to view distribution of\nvarOfInterest <- names(numLvls)[1:4]\n\n#print out all 4 plots using custom function\nlapply(varOfInterest,function(varName){\n  ggplot(info_temp,aes(info_temp[[varName]]))+ #removed ,fill=info_temp[[varName]]\n    geom_bar(stat=\"count\")+\n    labs(title=varName,x=\"Unique Levels\",y=\"Count\")+\n    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90))\n})\n```\n\nNote: I chose to not use color/fill because it caused loading issues. Will have to fix/create plot for \"Association\" col.","metadata":{}}]}
