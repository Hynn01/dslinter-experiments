Feature Engineering and Feature Selection</center>\nIn this course, we have already seen several key machine learning algorithms. However, before moving on to the more fancy ones, we’d like to take a small detour and talk about data preparation. The well-known concept of “garbage in — garbage out” applies 100% to any task in machine learning. Any experienced professional can recall numerous times when a simple model trained on high-quality data was proven to be better than a complicated multi-model ensemble built on data that wasn’t clean.\n\nTo start, I wanted to review three similar but different tasks:\n* **feature extraction** and **feature engineering**: transformation of raw data into features suitable for modeling;\n* **feature transformation**: transformation of data to improve the accuracy of the algorithm;\n* **feature selection**: removing unnecessary features.\n\nThis article will contain almost no math, but there will be a fair amount of code. Some examples will use the dataset from Renthop company, which is used in the [Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries) (just in case the dataset is no longer available on Kaggle, [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_lqydkMrmyNAgG4vU4wVmp6-j7tV0XI8) is it's copy). In this task, you need to predict the popularity of a new rental listing, i.e. classify the listing into three classes: `['low', 'medium' , 'high']`. To evaluate the solutions, we will use the log loss metric (the smaller, the better). Those who do not have a Kaggle account, will have to register; you will also need to accept the rules of the competition in order to download the data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ec094d401cd1e3c3573f70e255b3591305800d1f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Article outline\n\n1.

Feature Extraction\n\nIn practice, data rarely comes in the form of ready-to-use matrices. That's why every task begins with feature extraction.

Let's look at some of the popular types of data from which features can be extracted."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bac8c4209e05e66bc88f58f2f00a45f668037fef"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Texts\n\nText is a type of data that can come in different formats; there are so many text processing methods that cannot fit in a single article. Nevertheless, we will review the most popular ones.\n\nBefore working with text, one must tokenize it. Tokenization implies splitting the text into units (hence, tokens). Most simply, tokens are just the words. But splitting by word can lose some of the meaning -- \"Santa Barbara\" is one token, not two, but \"rock'n'roll\" should not be split into two tokens. There are ready-to-use tokenizers that take into account peculiarities of the language, but they make mistakes as well, especially when you work with specific sources of text (newspapers, slang, misspellings, typos).\n\nAfter tokenization, you will normalize the data. For text, this is about stemming and/or lemmatization; these are similar processes used to process different forms of a word. One can read about the difference between them [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/stemming-and-lemmatization-1.html).\n\nSo, now that we have turned the document into a sequence of words, we can represent it with vectors. The easiest approach is called Bag of Words: we create a vector with the length of the dictionary, compute the number of occurrences of each word in the text, and place that number of occurrences in the appropriate position in the vector. The process described looks simpler in code:"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:07.087385Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:07.068964Z"},"_uuid":"822ce118a5734980ebd2346fc1bbade489689071","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from functools import reduce \nimport numpy as np\n\ntexts = [['i', 'have', 'a', 'cat'], \n        ['he', 'have', 'a', 'dog'], \n        ['he', 'and', 'i', 'have', 'a', 'cat', 'and', 'a', 'dog']]\n\ndictionary = list(enumerate(set(list(reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, texts)))))\n\ndef vectorize(text): \n    vector = np.zeros(len(dictionary)) \n    for i, word in dictionary: \n        num = 0 \n        for w in text: \n            if w == word: \n                num += 1 \n        if num: \n            vector[i] = num \n    return vector\n\nfor t in texts: \n    print(vectorize(t))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"569eefe54f9d3ea0c6e9399a13fa4f77f01fe020"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here is an illustration of the process:\n\n<img src=https://habrastorage.org/webt/r7/sq/my/r7sqmyj1nmqmzltaftt40zi7-gw.png width=50%>\n\nThis is an extremely naive implementation. In practice, you need to consider stop words, the maximum length of the dictionary, more efficient data structures (usually text data is converted to a sparse vector), etc.\n\nWhen using algorithms like Bag of Words, we lose the order of the words in the text, which means that the texts \"i have no cows\" and \"no, i have cows\" will appear identical after vectorization when, in fact, they have the opposite meaning. To avoid this problem, we can revisit our tokenization step and use N-grams (the *sequence* of N consecutive tokens) instead."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:08.998673Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:07.088376Z"},"_uuid":"80ad413327edc16b40a52c5995058edf0c3bbf94","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n\nvect = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,1))\nvect.fit_transform(['no i have cows', 'i have no cows']).toarray()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:09.002804Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:08.999801Z"},"_uuid":"7f533f0c7f045f5c5f9b53e8e2447e13a3d63d77","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"vect.vocabulary_ ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:09.110448Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:09.003924Z"},"_uuid":"c29101e3954bc229a33ba15ed3bf8b82762bbb4b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"vect = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2))\nvect.fit_transform(['no i have cows', 'i have no cows']).toarray()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:09.218867Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:09.113204Z"},"_uuid":"19ab9640ed117e474604c3f1f7bae64650d3d225","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"vect.vocabulary_","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-14T14:13:25.767656Z","start_time":"2018-03-14T14:13:25.763924Z"},"_uuid":"327aede2132a9960b978b76db29de486a6eb0a67"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Also note that one does not have to use only words.

Then it makes sense to increase the weight of more domain-specific words to separate them out from common words. This approach is called TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), which cannot be written in a few lines, so you should look into the details in references such as [this wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf). The default option is as follows:\n\n$$ \\large idf(t,D) = \\log\\frac{\\mid D\\mid}{df(d,t)+1} $$\n\n$$ \\large tfidf(t,d,D) = tf(t,d) \\times idf(t,D) $$\n\nAnalogs of Bag of Words can be found outside of text problems e.g. bag of sites in the [Catch Me If You Can competition](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking), [bag of apps](https://www.kaggle.com/xiaoml/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics/bag-of-app-id-python-2-27392), [bag of events](http://www.interdigital.com/download/58540a46e3b9659c9f000372), etc.\n\n![image](https://habrastorage.org/webt/r7/sq/my/r7sqmyj1nmqmzltaftt40zi7-gw.png)\n\nUsing these algorithms, it is possible to obtain a working solution for a simple problem, which can serve as a baseline. However, for those who do not like the classics, there are new approaches. The most popular method in the new wave is Word2Vec, but there are a few alternatives as well (GloVe, Fasttext, etc.).\n\nWord2Vec is a special case of the word embedding algorithms. Using Word2Vec and similar models, we can not only vectorize words in a high-dimensional space (typically a few hundred dimensions) but also compare their semantic similarity. This is a classic example of operations that can be performed on vectorized concepts: king - man + woman = queen.\n\n![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K5X4N-MJKt8FGFtrTHwidg.gif)\n\nIt is worth noting that this model does not comprehend the meaning of the words but simply tries to position the vectors such that words used in common context are close to each other. If this is not taken into account, a lot of fun examples will come up.\n\nSuch models need to be trained on very large datasets in order for the vector coordinates to capture the semantics. A pretrained model for your own tasks can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api#where-to-get-a-pretrained-models).\n\nSimilar methods are applied in other areas such as bioinformatics. An unexpected application is [food2vec](https://jaan.io/food2vec-augmented-cooking-machine-intelligence/). You can probably think of a few other fresh ideas; the concept is universal enough."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7ab179d439e482251e8377abd6f0d53e49a136ad"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Images\n\nWorking with images is easier and harder at the same time. It is easier because it is possible to just use one of the popular pretrained networks without much thinking but harder because, if you need to dig into the details, you may end up going really deep. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nIn a time when GPUs were weaker and the \"renaissance of neural networks\" had not happened yet, feature generation from images was its own complex field. One had to work at a low level, determining corners, borders of regions, color distributions statistics, and so on. Experienced specialists in computer vision could draw a lot of parallels between older approaches and neural networks; in particular, convolutional layers in today's networks are similar to [Haar cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature). If you are interested in reading more, here are a couple of links to some interesting libraries: [skimage](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.feature.html) and [SimpleCV](http://simplecv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SimpleCV.Features.html).\n\nOften for problems associated with images, a convolutional neural network is used. You do not have to come up with the architecture and train a network from scratch. Instead, download a pretrained state-of-the-art network with the weights from public sources. Data scientists often do so-called fine-tuning to adapt these networks to their needs by \"detaching\" the last fully connected layers of the network, adding new layers chosen for a specific task, and then training the network on new data. If your task is to just vectorize the image (for example, to use some non-network classifier), you only need to remove the last layers and use the output from the previous layers:"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:25.71468Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:09.775547Z"},"_uuid":"efbf7aafb59674c5a7e37eab7ab61f9252001d3f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install Keras (https://keras.io/)\nfrom keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50, preprocess_input\nfrom keras.preprocessing import image \nfrom scipy.misc import face \nimport numpy as np\n\nresnet_settings = {'include_top': False, 'weights': 'imagenet'}\nresnet = ResNet50(**resnet_settings)\n\n# What a cute raccoon!\nimg = image.array_to_img(face())\nimg","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:27.770041Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:25.718729Z"},"_uuid":"f3660d6342d30c753d55f58195b62ecc0398bbd9","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# In real life, you may need to pay more attention to resizing\nimg = img.resize((224, 224))\n\nx = image.img_to_array(img) \nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = preprocess_input(x)\n\n# Need an extra dimension because model is designed to work with an array\n# of images - i.e. tensor shaped (batch_size, width, height, n_channels)\n\nfeatures = resnet.predict(x)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-14T14:44:25.102755Z","start_time":"2018-03-14T14:44:24.374869Z"},"_uuid":"133ff3fae82f7143544913d82e92311e36f21e03"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Iw_cKFwLkTVO2SPrOZU2rQ.png)\n\n*Here's a classifier trained on one dataset and adapted for a different one by \"detaching\" the last layer and adding a new one instead.*\n\nNevertheless, we should not focus too much on neural network techniques.

Depending on the task, you may need two mutually-inverse operations: geocoding (recovering a point from an address) and reverse geocoding (recovering an address from a point). Both operations are accessible in practice via external APIs from Google Maps or OpenStreetMap. Different geocoders have their own characteristics, and the quality varies from region to region. Fortunately, there are universal libraries like [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) that act as wrappers for these external services.\n\nIf you have a lot of data, you will quickly reach the limits of external API. Besides, it is not always the fastest to receive information via HTTP.

At the same time, if you encode them as categorical variables, you'll breed a large numbers of features and lose information about proximity -- the difference between 22 and 23 will be the same as the difference between 22 and 7.\n\nThere also exist some more esoteric approaches to such data like projecting the time onto a circle and using the two coordinates."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:27.78232Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:27.772449Z"},"_uuid":"69cd22dceedcc0de3247e9d25cf15752236783c2","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def make_harmonic_features(value, period=24):\n    value *= 2 * np.pi / period \n    return np.cos(value), np.sin(value)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"51cbf0b4a90241176cba33306858169900ae8f37"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This transformation preserves the distance between points, which is important for algorithms that estimate distance (kNN, SVM, k-means ...)"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:27.883311Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:27.784833Z"},"_uuid":"efdbbb971edbd71726a3f78a64077b570058b77e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy.spatial import distance\neuclidean(make_harmonic_features(23), make_harmonic_features(1)) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:28.250852Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:27.884753Z"},"_uuid":"096479f469fbaa67cd680ca4eab9fcd05827a87e","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"euclidean(make_harmonic_features(9), make_harmonic_features(11)) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:28.801865Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:28.252109Z"},"_uuid":"6db1a56625d81de629b14db669ef836ddc90c205","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"euclidean(make_harmonic_features(9), make_harmonic_features(21))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d000c274c55e75cd9e24242ea805becbbd513a63"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"However, the difference between such coding methods is down to the third decimal place in the metric."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6538885acbd2c7ba6117b435e158b0fff4e4d518"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Time series, web, etc.\n\nRegarding time series — we will not go into too much detail here (mostly due to my personal lack of experience), but I will point you to a [useful library that automatically generates features for time series](https://github.com/blue-yonder/tsfresh).\n\nIf you are working with web data, then you usually have information about the user's User Agent.

This is one of the reasons for the increased popularity of decision trees and all its derivative algorithms (random forest, gradient boosting). Not everyone can or want to tinker with transformations, and these algorithms are robust to unusual distributions.\n\nThere are also purely engineering reasons: `np.log` is a way of dealing with large numbers that do not fit in `np.float64`. This is an exception rather than a rule; often it's driven by the desire to adapt the dataset to the requirements of the algorithm. Parametric methods usually require a minimum of symmetric and unimodal distribution of data, which is not always given in real data. There may be more stringent requirements; recall [our earlier article about linear models](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course/open-machine-learning-course-topic-4-linear-classification-and-regression-44a41b9b5220).\n\nHowever, data requirements are imposed not only by parametric methods; [K nearest neighbors](https://medium.com/open-machine-learning-course/open-machine-learning-course-topic-3-classification-decision-trees-and-k-nearest-neighbors-8613c6b6d2cd) will predict complete nonsense if features are not normalized e.g. when one distribution is located in the vicinity of zero and does not go beyond (-1, 1) while the other’s range is on the order of hundreds of thousands.\n\nA simple example: suppose that the task is to predict the cost of an apartment from two variables — the distance from city center and the number of rooms. The number of rooms rarely exceeds 5 whereas the distance from city center can easily be in the thousands of meters.\n\nThe simplest transformation is Standard Scaling (or Z-score normalization):\n\n$$ \\large z= \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} $$\n\nNote that Standard Scaling does not make the distribution normal in the strict sense."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.382748Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.33832Z"},"_uuid":"a64e662c3f3a7a6a0d7cbab44dc4e848da3901dc","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom scipy.stats import beta\nfrom scipy.stats import shapiro\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata = beta(1, 10).rvs(1000).reshape(-1, 1)\nshapiro(data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.50959Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.38502Z"},"_uuid":"6bdd9e7c8025557ee0fdef6d663a5880d2e2fd14","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Value of the statistic, p-value\nshapiro(StandardScaler().fit_transform(data))\n\n# With such p-value we'd have to reject the null hypothesis of normality of the data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7a4c3eb2fef4d9d079d6981ce3b07ac8a532c9b2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"But, to some extent, it protects against outliers:"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.602528Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.51115Z"},"_uuid":"e896c85fb9a3fe8a2f4ba850e7129bd5b12c4785","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = np.array([1, 1, 0, -1, 2, 1, 2, 3, -2, 4, 100]).reshape(-1, 1).astype(np.float64)\nStandardScaler().fit_transform(data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.713603Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.605288Z"},"_uuid":"becc1336bddd704604bb9bfb658510febcbcf3e6","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(data - data.mean()) / data.std()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e6af03ee9e9c2e0bc50f3cc32895d8e91071d0ac"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Another fairly popular option is MinMax Scaling, which brings all the points within a predetermined interval (typically (0, 1)).\n\n$$ \\large X_{norm}=\\frac{X-X_{min}}{X_{max}-X_{min}} $$"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.855619Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.716Z"},"_uuid":"efce2986cd3121a68b88c5be7f9de7ceb6a27c4f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\nMinMaxScaler().fit_transform(data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.955155Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:29.857042Z"},"_uuid":"9e6ccd66c2e253809d6fc595f389ae8ef19b5b57","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(data - data.min()) / (data.max() - data.min()) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"80eb66a73eb26b62ab218e649daa6166b4f3d6b0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"StandardScaling and MinMax Scaling have similar applications and are often more or less interchangeable.

Furthermore, one can try to use other similar transformations, formulating their own hypotheses on how to approximate the available distribution to a normal.

So, one can consider cutting features with variance below a certain threshold."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.66929Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:33.80176Z"},"_uuid":"608c7440d5ddc47cd1b7ac20f36084aae46938e2","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\n\nx_data_generated, y_data_generated = make_classification()\nx_data_generated.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.674947Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.670899Z"},"_uuid":"d4ff67421df88491dea1778e12ea18dbc4e6845b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"VarianceThreshold(.7).fit_transform(x_data_generated).shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.801683Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.67613Z"},"_uuid":"511de784c95c008fbf5c317a2a94e01962b878c4","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"VarianceThreshold(.8).fit_transform(x_data_generated).shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.903665Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.803278Z"},"_uuid":"f9dedf8612f24c792f255b4a6da71004184e7dec","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"VarianceThreshold(.9).fit_transform(x_data_generated).shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c990cd7d795413a3070afca84fbedad664fb467d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are other ways that are also [based on classical statistics](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#univariate-feature-selection)."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:35.235212Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:34.908459Z"},"_uuid":"6cb76a81d3f41bebb8149183689c77b835e8f86b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\nx_data_kbest = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=5).fit_transform(x_data_generated, y_data_generated)\nx_data_varth = VarianceThreshold(.9).fit_transform(x_data_generated)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:35.25127Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:35.237608Z"},"_uuid":"ff434e9f1dfe25be8737d16ba190cf9779d4611b","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cross_val_score(LogisticRegression(), x_data_generated, y_data_generated, scoring='neg_log_loss').mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:35.355729Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:35.252493Z"},"_uuid":"ad9a330e3ccaa3d7e4eebaf6fe8ebd8b84d079b1","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cross_val_score(LogisticRegression(), x_data_kbest, y_data_generated, scoring='neg_log_loss').mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:35.50034Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:35.356862Z"},"_uuid":"034ef875ec58c99a0ffa74c19abfabde4d0c3839","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"cross_val_score(LogisticRegression(), x_data_varth, y_data_generated, scoring='neg_log_loss').mean()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"35d28dc214e582782e9d3821cd82f42e74402415"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that our selected features have improved the quality of the classifier.

Train a model on a subset of features, store results, repeat for different subsets, and compare the quality of models to identify the best feature set. This approach is called [Exhaustive Feature Selection](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/ExhaustiveFeatureSelector/).\n\nSearching all combinations usually takes too long, so you can try to reduce the search space. Fix a small number N, iterate through all combinations of N features, choose the best combination, and then iterate through the combinations of (N + 1) features so that the previous best combination of features is fixed and only a single new feature is considered. It is possible to iterate until we hit a maximum number of characteristics or until the quality of the model ceases to increase significantly. This algorithm is called [Sequential Feature Selection](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/SequentialFeatureSelector/).\n\nThis algorithm can be reversed: start with the complete feature space and remove features one by one until it does not impair the quality of the model or until the desired number of features is reached."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:44.047841Z","start_time":"2018-03-15T14:06:36.096849Z"},"_uuid":"35a9360b5cdc4bbb98b52e53e644458fee4c0d1f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install mlxtend\nfrom mlxtend.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector\n\nselector = SequentialFeatureSelector(LogisticRegression(), scoring='neg_log_loss', \n                                     verbose=2, k_features=3, forward=False, n_jobs=-1)\n\nselector.fit(x_data, y_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d56858bf86689fb43c5357c23d3e3fced43f674b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Take a look how this approach was done in one [simple yet elegant Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/arsenyinfo/easy-feature-selection-pipeline-0-55-at-lb)."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"},"toc":{"nav_menu":{},"number_sections":true,"sideBar":true,"skip_h1_title":false,"title_cell":"Table of Contents","title_sidebar":"Contents","toc_cell":false,"toc_position":{},"toc_section_display":true,"toc_window_display":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
