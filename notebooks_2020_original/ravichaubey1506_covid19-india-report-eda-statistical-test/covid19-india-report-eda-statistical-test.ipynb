I am little bit late in contribution to COVID19, But i will make sure this notebook will be worth to some extent. I am going to analyze COVID19 for India only in my first notebook, Later i will cover more!! Thank you for being here, Happy Reading !! :)\n\n### COVID19:\n\n<img src=\"https://eyewire.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/banner-2.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\">\n\n\nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.\nMost people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.\n\n\n### HOW IT SPREADS?\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.\nYou can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\n### To prevent the spread of COVID-19:\n\n* Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.\n\n* Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n\n* Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\n* Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.\n\n* Stay home if you feel unwell.\n\n* If you have a fever, a cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance.\n\n* Follow the directions of your local health authority.\n\n**Avoiding unneeded visits to medical facilities allows healthcare systems to operate more effectively, therefore protecting you and others.**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport cufflinks as cf\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\ncf.go_offline()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"covid19Personal = pd.read_csv('../input/covid19-india/covidIndiaSimple.csv')\ncovid19Personal.drop('Unnamed: 0',axis = 1,inplace =True)\ncovid19Personal.drop([32,33,34],inplace=True)\ncovid19Personal['Total Confirmed cases']=covid19Personal['Total Confirmed cases'].astype('int')\ncovid19Personal['Cured']=covid19Personal['Cured'].astype('int')\ncovid19Personal['Death']=covid19Personal['Death'].astype('int')\ncovid19Personal.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"covid_df = pd.read_csv('../input/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/covid_19_data.csv',index_col=1,parse_dates=True)\ncovid_df.drop(['Last Update','SNo'],axis = 1, inplace = True)\ncovid_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"covid_india = covid_df[covid_df['Country/Region']=='India']\ncovid_india.index.freq = 'D'\ncovid_india.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"covid_indStates = pd.read_csv('../input/covid19-in-india/covid_19_india.csv',index_col=1,parse_dates=True)\ncovid_indStates.drop(['Sno','Time'],axis = 1, inplace = True)\ncovid_indStates.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# EDA :\n\nLet us look at some EDA, I love to find statistical evidence from data.

This <em>may</em> indicate the presence of causality, that changes in the first series influenced the behavior of the second. However, it may also be that both series are affected by some third factor, just at different rates.
