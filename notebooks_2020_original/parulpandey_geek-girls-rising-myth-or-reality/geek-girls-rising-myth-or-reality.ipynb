The idea behind these efforts is that attracting and retaining more women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will ultimately enhance innovation and creativity. When women are not involved in these fields, experiences, needs, and desires that are unique to women may be overlooked.\n\nIt is not that there aren't any female role models out there to inspire us.\nDo you remember the iconic photograph of** Katie Bouman in 2019**, watching the black hole's first photograph as it was being reconstructed? Not only was it a breakthrough moment for the scientific community, but an equally proud one for all the women scientists all over the world. A historic moment not just for science, but for women in science, too.\n\n![](https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sizes/katieboumanfacebookmain_resize_md.jpg)\n\nSimilarly, women have also been making significant contributions to the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science. Be it **Margaret Hamilton** or **Grace Hopper** in the past or** Corinna Cortes** and **Fei Fei Li** today; women have made their presence felt with their work. More and more girls are being motivated to take up science and research in school and colleges. A lot of companies today are coming forward to change the world of work. This year, even the United Nations celebrated International Women's Day under the official theme **#BalanceforBetter**, advocating a more gender-balanced world.\n\nHowever, as it may seem, not everything is still so \"gung-ho\" when it comes to women's representation is the Data Science field. The ratios are still skewed, and women still occupy far fewer leadership roles than men. But let's not just assume things but rather use data to verify our assumptions, and the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS survey is an excellent place to start. Let the numbers speak for themselves.\n\n## Objective\nThe objective of this notebook to analyze the survey data to answer an important question: is the women participation in STEM really improving, or is it just a hype? Let's use our analysis skills to investigate whether things seem to be actually improving or is still much left to be done.\n\n## The Annual Kaggle survey\nKaggle's annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey is in its third year now. This year, as in [2017](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017) and [2018](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018/), Kaggle has conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The Survey Challenges from 2017 and 2018 were very informative, and so is expected out of the 2019 survey too.\n\n## Methodology\nThis notebook will only focus on the women in ML and DS, thereby analyzing the answers of the female respondents solely. The analysis will be two-fold:\n\n* Analysis of the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML survey for Female respondents.\n* Comparisons of the results in the 2019 study with the previous two surveys. This will present a better picture and show whether are things are improving for real or not.\n\nIn this notebook, we shall analyze the female participation in the survey under six different categories, namely:\n\n![](https://imgur.com/6thMxvI.png)\n\nAnalyzing data under these different categories should give us a fair idea of the nature of women's representation is the ML and DS realm."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import the necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \n\n# Visualisation libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot \nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport pycountry\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport folium \nfrom folium import plugins\n\n# Graphics in retina format \n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' \n\n# Increase the default plot size and set the color scheme\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 8, 5\n#plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'viridis'\n\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# palette of colors to be used for plots\ncolors = [\"steelblue\",\"dodgerblue\",\"lightskyblue\",\"powderblue\",\"cyan\",\"deepskyblue\",\"cyan\",\"darkturquoise\",\"paleturquoise\",\"turquoise\"]\n\n\n# Disable warnings in Anaconda\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing the 2017,2018 and 2019 survey dataset\n\n#Importing the 2019 Dataset\ndf_2019 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv')\ndf_2019.columns = df_2019.iloc[0]\ndf_2019=df_2019.drop([0])\n\n#Importing the 2018 Dataset\ndf_2018 = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2018/multipleChoiceResponses.csv')\ndf_2018.columns = df_2018.iloc[0]\ndf_2018=df_2018.drop([0])\n\n#Importing the 2017 Dataset\ndf_2017=pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2017/multipleChoiceResponses.csv',encoding='ISO-8859-1')\n\n\n# Helper functions\n\ndef return_count(data,question_part):\n    \"\"\"Counts occurences of each value in a given column\"\"\"\n    counts_df = data[question_part].value_counts().to_frame()\n    return counts_df\n\ndef return_percentage(data,question_part):\n    \"\"\"Calculates percent of each value in a given column\"\"\"\n    total = data[question_part].count()\n    counts_df= data[question_part].value_counts().to_frame()\n    percentage_df = (counts_df*100)/total\n    return percentage_df\n\n\n    \ndef plot_graph(data,question,title,x_axis_title,y_axis_title):\n    \"\"\" plots a percentage bar graph\"\"\"\n    df = return_percentage(data,question)\n    \n    trace1 = go.Bar(\n                    x = df.index,\n                    y = df[question],\n                    #orientation='h',\n                    marker = dict(color='dodgerblue',\n                                 line=dict(color='black',width=1)),\n                    text = df.index)\n    data = [trace1]\n    layout = go.Layout(barmode = \"group\",title=title,width=800, height=500,\n                       xaxis=dict(type='category',categoryorder='array',categoryarray=salary_order,title=y_axis_title),\n                       yaxis= dict(title=x_axis_title))\n                       \n    fig = go.Figure(data = data, layout = layout)\n    iplot(fig)    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a>The State of Affairs Today - 2019</a> \n## <a> Top 10 Countries with the majority of respondents</a> \nLet's begin by analyzing the 2019 survey's dataset to get a big picture.

We need to see the reason behind such low participation and how we can encourage women to become more participative. Networking can be a great way for women to connect with other fellow women and help and encourage others. A lot of support groups are present which help to create a friendly and supportive environment for Women in Data Science where they can share knowledge, develop skills and also help others in finding jobs and advance their careers. Some of these groups are:\n>\n    * [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/)\n    * [Women in Machine Learning & Data Science](http://wimlds.org/)\n    * [Women in Tech Summit](https://womenintechsummit.net/)\n    * [Black Women in Computing](http://blackwomenincomputing.org/)\n    * [Rladies Global](https://rladies.org/)\n    * [PyLadies](https://www.pyladies.com/)\n    * [EdTechWomen](http://edtechwomen.com/chapters-and-events)\n    * [Widening Natural Language Processing](http://www.winlp.org/mission/)\n    * [Women in Big Data](https://www.womeninbigdata.org/)\n    \n\n* The response from the U.S and Indian women is really heartening, although it is still very low as compared to their male counterparts. Africa shows a glimmer of hope with countries like Nigeria and Algeria gearing up. Organizations should team up with the African government and NGOs to provide better opportunities for study and research to these women.\n* The young female populations in Data Science are on the rise with the majority coming from India. This is not surprising as India has one of the highest young brigades in the world. This demographic dividend should be tapped efficiently by reforming the existing Indian education model and introducing high-quality Data science courses in their existing curriculum.\n* The females in the  Science space are highly qualified with the majority having a Master's degree. \n* Most of the female Data Scientists are located in the U.S and India. Some women who are not employed have also responded to the survey. There could be multiple reasons for that. They could be students or women who wish to restart their careers after a break. The latter could be provided with assistance by getting them to attend meetups or community events. For the students, a mentorship is a good option.\n* The salary distribution has remained constant over the years but Indian female Data Scientists are paid comparatively less as compared to their counterparts in the U.S.\n\n\n\n# <a>Conclusion</a>\n\nSo let's get back to the initial question - Are the Geek Girls Rising? It's a mixed feeling. Some areas have shown improvement while a lot of work is required in others. Overall, things appear to be promising and if we could work towards it, future will be better than it is today.\nData science in itself is a combination of diverse scientific disciplines. It makes all the more sense to bring in people from different genders, backgrounds, and ethnicity. This way we can bring in more creativity and allow knowledge, discoveries, and innovation to flourish. \nIt will require a collaborative effort from society to make diversity and inclusion a vital part of the ecosystem. As women, we should also make sure that we create a strong support group among ourselves to assist our fellow females in the Data Science and STEM space. Afterall **Empowered women, empower women**."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
