Pandas Profiling\n\n**Profiling** is a process that helps us in understanding our data  and  [**Pandas**](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)[**Profiling**](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling)  is python package which does exactly that.  It is a simple and fast way to perform exploratory data analysis of a Pandas Dataframe.  The pandas`df.describe()`and  `df.info()functions` are normally used as a first step in the EDA process. However, it only gives a very basic overview of the data and doesn’t help much in the case of large data sets. The Pandas Profiling function, on the other hand, extends the pandas DataFrame  with`df.profile_report()`  for quick data analysis. It displays a lot of information with a single line of code and that too in an interactive HTML report.\n\nFor a given dataset the pandas profiling package computes the following statistics:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*T2iRcSpLLxXop7Naa4ln0g.png)\n\nRefer the  [documentation](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/)  for more details and examples.[](http://)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Usage\n\nLet’s use the titanic dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of the versatile python profiler."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport pandas_profiling \n\ntitanic_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To display the report in a Jupyter notebook, run the following code.

Interactive Pandas' plots\n\nThe **Pandas** library has a built-in `.plot()`  function as part of the DataFrame class.
