Natural choice for the test statistic is the difference in means between two groups.\n* The second step is to define null hypothesis that is model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect is not real. A null hypothesis is a type of hypothesis used in statistics that proposes that no statistical significance exists in a set of given observations. The null hypothesis is a hypothesis which people tries to disprove it. Alternative hypothesis is a hypothesis which people want to tries to prove it. \n* Third step is compute p-value that is probablity of seeing the apparent effect if the null hypothesis is true. Suppose we have null hypothesis test. Then we calculate p value. If p value is less than or equal to a threshold, we reject null hypothesis.\n* If the p-value is low, the effect is said to be statistacally significant that means that it is unlikely to have occured by chance. Therefore we can say that the effect is more likely to appear in the larger population.\n* Lets have an example. Null hypothesis: world is flatten. Alternative hypothesis: world is round. Several scientists set out to disprove the null hypothesis. This eventually led to the refection of the null hypothesis and acceptance of the alternative hypothesis.\n* Other example. \"this effect is real\" this is null hypothesis. Based on that assumption we compute the probability of the apparent effect. That is the p-value. If p-value is low, we conclude that null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.\n* Now lets make our example:\n    * I want to learn that are radius mean and area mean related with each other? My null hypothesis is that \"relationship between radius mean and area mean is zero in tumor population'.\n    * Now we need to refute this null hypothesis in order to demonstrate that radius mean and area mean are related.
