Box plots are non-parametric: they display variation in samples of a statistical population without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution. \n\nThe spacings between the different parts of the box indicate the degree of dispersion (spread) and skewness in the data, and show outliers. \n\nIn addition to the points themselves, they allow one to visually estimate various L-estimators, notably the interquartile range, midhinge, range, mid-range, and trimean. \n\nBox plots can be drawn either horizontally or vertically.
