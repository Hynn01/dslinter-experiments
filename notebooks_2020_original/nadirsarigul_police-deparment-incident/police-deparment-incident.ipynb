To do that, we will part ways with Matplotlib and work with another Python visualization library, namely Folium. What is nice about Folium is that it was developed for the sole purpose of visualizing geospatial data. While other libraries are available to visualize geospatial data, such as plotly, they might have a cap on how many API calls you can make within a defined time frame. Folium, on the other hand, is completely free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Datasets:\nSan Francisco Police Department Incidents for the year 2016 - Police Department Incidents from San Francisco public data portal.
