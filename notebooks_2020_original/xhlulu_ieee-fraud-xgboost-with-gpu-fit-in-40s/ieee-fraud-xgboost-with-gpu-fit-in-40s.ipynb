The official starter kernel is **AWESOME**; it's so simple, clean, straightforward, and pragmatic. It certainly saved me a lot of time wrangling with data, so that I can directly start tuning my models (real data scientists will call me lazy, but hey I'm an engineer I just want my stuff to work).\n\nI noticed two tiny problems with it:\n* It takes a lot of RAM to run, which means that if you are using a GPU, it might crash as you try to fill missing values.\n* It takes a while to run (roughly 3500 seconds, which is more than an hour; again, I'm a lazy guy and I don't like waiting).\n\nWith this kernel, I bring some small changes:\n* Decrease RAM usage, so that it won't crash when you change it to GPU. I simply changed when we are deleting unused variables.\n* Decrease **running time from ~3500s to ~40s** (yes, that's almost 90x faster), at the cost of a slight decrease in score. This is done by adding a single argument.\n\nAgain, my changes are super minimal (cause Inversion's kernel was already so awesome), but I hope it will save you some time and trouble (so that you can start working on cool stuff).\n\n\n### Changelog\n\n**V4**\n* Change some wording\n* Prints XGBoost version\n* Add random state to XGB for reproducibility"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport xgboost as xgb","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"XGBoost version:\", xgb.__version__)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Efficient Preprocessing\n\nThis preprocessing method is more careful with RAM usage, which avoids crashing the kernel when you switch from CPU to GPU.

Similarly, `tree_method='gpu_exact'` will take ~ 4 min, but likely yields better accuracy than `gpu_hist` or `hist`.\n\nThe [docs on parameters](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html) has a section on `tree_method`, and it goes over the details of each option."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sample_submission['isFraud'] = clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]\nsample_submission.to_csv('simple_xgboost.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
