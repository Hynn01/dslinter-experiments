It doesn't require learning any new visualization techniques. The limitations are the same ones that held for the plots you use inside.\n\nFaceting does have some important limitations however. It can only be used to break data out across singular or paired categorical variables with very low numeracy&mdash;any more than five or so dimensions in the grid, and the plots become too small (or involve a lot of scrolling). Additionally it involves choosing (or letting Python) an order to plot in, but with nominal categorical variables that choice is distractingly arbitrary.\n\nNevertheless, faceting is an extremely useful and applicable tool to have in your toolbox."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ab1ba195f45e42f3541c30d1b2a38f5426ebcd68","_cell_guid":"885165ab-1f3d-42c8-bfad-ff0450301248"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pairplot\n\nNow that we understand faceting, it's worth taking a quick once-over of the `seaborn` `pairplot` function.\n\n`pairplot` is a very useful and widely used `seaborn` method for faceting *variables* (as opposed to *variable values*).
