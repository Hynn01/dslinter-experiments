However, the meaning of some of the column headers are not obvious. Here's what they mean,\n\n- **age**: The person's age in years\n- **sex**: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)\n- **cp:** The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)\n- **trestbps:** The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n- **chol:** The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl\n- **fbs:** The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false) \n- **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)\n- **thalach:** The person's maximum heart rate achieved\n- **exang:** Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n- **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more [here](https://litfl.com/st-segment-ecg-library/))\n- **slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)\n- **ca:** The number of major vessels (0-3)\n- **thal:** A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)\n- **target:** Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)\n\nTo avoid [HARKing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327957pspr0203_4) (or Hypothesizing After the Results are Known) I'm going to take a look at online guides on how heart disease is diagnosed, and look up some of the terms above.\n\n**Diagnosis**: The diagnosis of heart disease is done on a combination of clinical signs and test results. The types of tests run will be chosen on the basis of what the physician thinks is going on [1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353124), ranging from electrocardiograms and cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scans, to blood tests and exercise stress tests [2](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/your-heart/living-with-heart-disease/medical-tests).\n\nLooking at information of heart disease risk factors led me to the following: **high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking** [3](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors). According to another source [4](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/understand-your-risks-to-prevent-a-heart-attack), the major factors that can't be changed are: **increasing age, male gender and heredity**. Note that **thalassemia**, one of the variables in this dataset, is heredity. Major factors that can be modified are: **Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes**. Other factors include **stress, alcohol and poor diet/nutrition**.\n\nI can see no reference to the 'number of major vessels', but given that the definition of heart disease is **\"...what happens when your heart's blood supply is blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances in the coronary arteries\"**, it seems logical the *more* major vessels is a good thing, and therefore will reduce the probability of heart disease.\n\nGiven the above, I would hypothesis that, if the model has some predictive ability, we'll see these factors standing out as the most important."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"292680a300ed85d67ba66e3a9a98b5b623d8aea5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's change the column names to be a bit clearer,"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f3caf3de0a7e6d4602b26a1e72bf42d42ef0aac0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dt.columns = ['age', 'sex', 'chest_pain_type', 'resting_blood_pressure', 'cholesterol', 'fasting_blood_sugar', 'rest_ecg', 'max_heart_rate_achieved',\n       'exercise_induced_angina', 'st_depression', 'st_slope', 'num_major_vessels', 'thalassemia', 'target']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"495ae90ddc6138810d5be6272cf6db9a3b6c5397"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I'm also going to change the values of the categorical variables, to improve the interpretation later on,"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"755235c8db67e5d76ee2fdc5cd55390e60e61ee9"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dt['sex'][dt['sex'] == 0] = 'female'\ndt['sex'][dt['sex'] == 1] = 'male'\n\ndt['chest_pain_type'][dt['chest_pain_type'] == 1] = 'typical angina'\ndt['chest_pain_type'][dt['chest_pain_type'] == 2] = 'atypical angina'\ndt['chest_pain_type'][dt['chest_pain_type'] == 3] = 'non-anginal pain'\ndt['chest_pain_type'][dt['chest_pain_type'] == 4] = 'asymptomatic'\n\ndt['fasting_blood_sugar'][dt['fasting_blood_sugar'] == 0] = 'lower than 120mg/ml'\ndt['fasting_blood_sugar'][dt['fasting_blood_sugar'] == 1] = 'greater than 120mg/ml'\n\ndt['rest_ecg'][dt['rest_ecg'] == 0] = 'normal'\ndt['rest_ecg'][dt['rest_ecg'] == 1] = 'ST-T wave abnormality'\ndt['rest_ecg'][dt['rest_ecg'] == 2] = 'left ventricular hypertrophy'\n\ndt['exercise_induced_angina'][dt['exercise_induced_angina'] == 0] = 'no'\ndt['exercise_induced_angina'][dt['exercise_induced_angina'] == 1] = 'yes'\n\ndt['st_slope'][dt['st_slope'] == 1] = 'upsloping'\ndt['st_slope'][dt['st_slope'] == 2] = 'flat'\ndt['st_slope'][dt['st_slope'] == 3] = 'downsloping'\n\ndt['thalassemia'][dt['thalassemia'] == 1] = 'normal'\ndt['thalassemia'][dt['thalassemia'] == 2] = 'fixed defect'\ndt['thalassemia'][dt['thalassemia'] == 3] = 'reversable defect'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6784e0464c75cda38e12e6e70c9ea9fef809bec4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Check the data types,"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d9071ced2d8af54afece86069d15189a73b57198"},"cell_type":"code","source":"dt.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6719808a43af6e2a70306d22c9107d4201bd8953"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some of those aren't quite right.

Komaroff, MD, an internal medicine specialist [5](https://www.sharecare.com/health/circulatory-system-health/what-st-segment-electrocardiogram-ecg) .... *\"An electrocardiogram (ECG) measures the heart's electrical activity. The waves that appear on it are labeled P, QRS, and T. Each corresponds to a different part of the heartbeat. The **ST segment** represents the heart's electrical activity immediately after the right and left ventricles have contracted, pumping blood to the lungs and the rest of the body. Following this big effort, ventricular muscle cells relax and get ready for the next contraction. During this period, little or no electricity is flowing, so the ST segment is even with the baseline or sometimes slightly above it. The faster the heart is beating during an ECG, the shorter all of the waves become. **The shape and direction of the ST segment are far more important than its length. Upward or downward shifts can represent decreased blood flow to the heart from a variety of causes, including heart attack, spasms in one or more coronary arteries (Prinzmetal's angina), infection of the lining of the heart (pericarditis) or the heart muscle itself (myocarditis), an excess of potassium in the bloodstream, a heart rhythm problem, or a blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism).\"***\n\n<img style=\"float: left;\" src=\"https://www.cvphysiology.com/uploads/images/CAD012%20ST%20elevation.png\" width=\"350px\"/>    [6](https://www.cvphysiology.com/CAD/CAD012)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"569911494e9449703f8dd6e19137c155c6570bf8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So, this variable, which is described as 'ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest', seems to suggest the higher the value the higher the probability of heart disease, but the plot above shows the opposite.

However, it's allowed us to create a simple model and then use various machine learning explainability tools and techniques to peek inside. At the start, I hypothesised, using (Googled) domain knowledge that factors such as cholesterol and age would be major factors in the model. This dataset didn't show that. Instead, the number of major factors and aspects of ECG results dominated. I actually feel like I've learnt a thing or two about heart disease!\n\nI suspect this sort of approach will become increasingly important as machine learning has a greater and greater role in health care."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
