This relationship can be explained by saying that first class passenger(1) paid more for fare then second class passenger(2), similarly second class passenger paid more than the third class passenger(3). This theory can also be supported by mentioning another Pclass correlation with our dependent variable, Survived. The correlation between Pclass and Survived is -0.33.

Statistical Test for Correlation\n<a id=\"statistical_test\"></a>\n***\n\nStatistical tests are the scientific way to prove the validation of theories. In any case, when we look at the data, we seem to have an intuitive understanding of where data is leading us. However, when we do statistical tests, we get a scientific or mathematical perspective of how significant these results are. Let's apply some of these methods and see how we are doing with our predictions.\n\n###  Hypothesis Testing Outline\n\nA hypothesis test compares the mean of a control group and experimental group and tries to find out whether the two sample means are different from each other and if they are different, how significant that difference is.\n \nA **hypothesis test** usually consists of multiple parts: \n\n1. Formulate a well-developed research problem or question: The hypothesis test usually starts with a concrete and well-developed researched problem. We need to ask the right question that can be answered using statistical analysis. \n2. **The null hypothesis($H_0$) and Alternating hypothesis($H_1$)**:\n> * The **null hypothesis($H_0$)** is something that is assumed to be true. It is the status quo. In a null hypothesis, the observations are the result of pure chance. When we set out to experiment, we form the null hypothesis by saying that there is no difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group.\n> *  An **Alternative hypothesis($H_A$)** is a claim and the opposite of the null hypothesis.  It is going against the status quo. In an alternative theory, the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation.\n    \n3. Determine the **test statistic**: test statistic can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. Depending on the standard deviation we either use t-statistics or z-statistics. In addition to that, we want to identify whether the test is a one-tailed test or two-tailed test. [This](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/basic-statistics/supporting-topics/basics/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/) article explains it pretty well. [This](https://stattrek.com/hypothesis-test/hypothesis-testing.aspx) article is pretty good as well. \n\n4. Specify a **Significance level** and **Confidence Interval**: The significance level($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, we are ***comfortable/confident*** with rejecting the null hypothesis a significant amount of times even though it is true. This considerable amount is our Significant level. In addition to that, Significance level is one minus our Confidence interval. For example, if we say, our significance level is 5%, then our confidence interval would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 or 95%. \n\n5. Compute the **T-Statistics/Z-Statistics**: Computing the t-statistics follows a simple equation. This equation slightly differs depending on one sample test or two sample test  \n\n6. Compute the **P-value**: P-value is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. The p-value is known to be unintuitive, and even many professors are known to explain it wrong. I think this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4KCfcVwzyw) explains the p-value well. **The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n\n7. **Describe the result and compare the p-value with the significance value($\\alpha$)**: If p<=$\\alpha$, then the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid. However if the p> $\\alpha$, we say that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even though this sentence is grammatically wrong, it is logically right. We never accept the null hypothesis just because we are doing the statistical test with sample data points.\n\nWe will follow each of these steps above to do your hypothesis testing below.\n\nP.S.

However, it is essential to understand what our end goal is. Here our dependent variable or target variable is **Survived**. Therefore, we say\n\n> ** Null Hypothesis($H_0$):** There is no difference in the survival rate between the male and female passengers. or the mean difference between male and female passenger in the survival rate is zero.  \n>  ** Alternative Hypothesis($H_A$):** There is a difference in the survival rate between the male and female passengers. or the mean difference in the survival rate between male and female is not zero.\n\n\nOnc thing we can do is try to set up the Null and Alternative Hypothesis in such way that, when we do our t-test, we can choose to do one tailed test. According to [this](https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/basic-statistics/supporting-topics/basics/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/) article, one-tailed tests are more powerful than two-tailed test. In addition to that, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NcMFlrnYp8&list=PLIeGtxpvyG-LrjxQ60pxZaimkaKKs0zGF) video is also quite helpful understanding these topics. with this in mind we can update/modify our null and alternative hypothesis. Let's see how we can rewrite this..\n\n> **Null Hypothesis(H0):** male mean is greater or equal to female mean.\n\n> **Alternative Hypothesis(H1):** male mean is less than female mean. \n\n#### Determine the test statistics:\n> This will be a two-tailed test since the difference between male and female passenger in the survival rate could be higher or lower than 0. \n> Since we do not know the standard deviation($\\sigma$) and n is small, we will use the t-distribution. \n\n#### Specify the significance level:\n> Specifying a significance level is an important step of the hypothesis test. It is an ultimate balance between type 1 error and type 2 error. We will discuss more in-depth about those in another lesson. For now, we have decided to make our significance level($\\alpha$) = 0.05. So, our confidence interval or non-rejection region would be (1 - $\\alpha$)=(1-0.05) = 95%. \n\n#### Computing T-statistics and P-value:\nLet's take a random sample and see the difference."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":59,"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"abd034cffc591bf1ef2b4a8ed3e5a65eb133d61e","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.771771Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.771345Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.783362Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.782301Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.771603Z"}},"outputs":[],"source":"male_mean = train[train['Sex'] == 1].Survived.mean()\n\nfemale_mean = train[train['Sex'] == 0].Survived.mean()\nprint (\"Male survival mean: \" + str(male_mean))\nprint (\"female survival mean: \" + str(female_mean))\n\nprint (\"The mean difference between male and female survival rate: \" + str(female_mean - male_mean))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"0c1c27af262ba094ff1fd02867b1a41d5369720f"},"source":"Now, we have to understand that those two means are not  **the population mean ($\\bar{\\mu}$)**.  *The population mean is a statistical term statistician uses to indicate the actual average of the entire group. The group can be any gathering of multiple numbers such as animal, human, plants, money, stocks.* For example, To find the age population mean of Bulgaria; we will have to account for every single person's age and take their age. Which is almost impossible and if we were to go that route; there is no point of doing statistics in the first place. Therefore we approach this problem using sample sets. The idea of using sample set is that; if we take multiple samples of the same population and take the mean of them and put them in a distribution; eventually the distribution start to look more like a **normal distribution**. The more samples we take and the more sample means will be added and, the closer the normal distribution will reach towards population mean. This is where **Central limit theory** comes from. We will go more in depth of this topic later on. \n\nGoing back to our dataset, like we are saying these means above are part of the whole story. We were given part of the data to train our machine learning models, and the other part of the data was held back for testing. Therefore, It is impossible for us at this point to know the population means of survival for male and females. Situation like this calls for a statistical approach. We will use the sampling distribution approach to do the test. let's take 50 random sample of male and female from our train data."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":60,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.785359Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.784861Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.815921Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.815302Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T16:35:15.785103Z"}},"outputs":[],"source":"# separating male and female dataframe. \nimport random\nmale = train[train['Sex'] == 1]\nfemale = train[train['Sex'] == 0]\n\n## empty list for storing mean sample\nm_mean_samples = []\nf_mean_samples = []\n\nfor i in range(50):\n    m_mean_samples.append(np.mean(random.sample(list(male['Survived']),50,)))\n    f_mean_samples.append(np.mean(random.sample(list(female['Survived']),50,)))\n    \n\n# Print them out\nprint (f\"Male mean sample mean: {round(np.mean(m_mean_samples),2)}\")\nprint (f\"Male mean sample mean: {round(np.mean(f_mean_samples),2)}\")\nprint (f\"Difference between male and female mean sample mean: {round(np.mean(f_mean_samples) - np.mean(m_mean_samples),2)}\")"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"H0: male mean is greater or equal to female mean<br>\nH1: male mean is less than female mean.

When we perform a **t-test** we are usually trying to find out **an evidence of significant difference between population mean with hypothesized mean(1 sample t-test) or in our case difference between two population means(2 sample t-test).** \n\n\n\nThe **t-statistics** is the measure of a degree to which our groups differ standardized by the variance of our measurements. In order words, it is basically the measure of signal over noise. Let us describe the previous sentence a bit more for clarification. I am going to use [this post](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/what-is-a-t-test-and-why-is-it-like-telling-a-kid-to-clean-up-that-mess-in-the-kitchen) as reference to describe the t-statistics here. \n\n\n#### Calculating the t-statistics\n# $$t = \\frac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{S} {\\sqrt{n}} }$$\n\nHere..\n* $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean. \n* $\\mu$ is the hypothesized mean. \n* S is the standard deviation. \n* n is the sample size. \n\n\n1. Now, the denominator of this fraction $(\\bar{x}-\\mu)$ is basically the strength of the signal. where we calculate the difference between hypothesized mean and sample mean. If the mean difference is higher, then the signal is stronger. \n\nthe numerator of this fraction ** ${S}/ {\\sqrt{n}}$ ** calculates the amount of variation or noise of the data set. Here S is standard deviation, which tells us how much variation is there in the data. n is the sample size. \n\nSo, according to the explanation above, the t-value or t-statistics is basically measures the strength of the signal(the difference) to the amount of noise(the variation) in the data and that is how we calculate the t-value in one sample t-test. However, in order to calculate between two sample population mean or in our case we will use the follow equation. \n\n# $$t = \\frac{\\bar{x}_M - \\bar{x}_F}{\\sqrt {s^2 (\\frac{1}{n_M} + \\frac{1}{n_F})}}$$\n\nThis equation may seem too complex, however, the idea behind these two are similar. Both of them have the concept of signal/noise. The only difference is that we replace our hypothesis mean with another sample mean and the two sample sizes repalce one sample size. \n\nHere..\n* $\\bar{x}_M$ is the mean of our male group sample measurements. \n* $ \\bar{x}_F$ is the mean of female group samples. \n* $ n_M$ and $n_F$ are the sample number of observations in each group. \n* $ S^2$ is the sample variance.\n\nIt is good to have an understanding of what going on in the background.

Splitting the training data\n<a id=\"split_training_data\" ></a>\n***\nThere are multiple ways of splitting data. They are...\n* train_test_split.\n* cross_validation. \n\nWe have separated dependent and independent features; We have separated train and test data. So, why do we still have to split our training data? If you are curious about that, I have the answer. For this competition, when we train the machine learning algorithms, we use part of the training set usually two-thirds of the train data. Once we train our algorithm using 2/3 of the train data, we start to test our algorithms using the remaining data. If the model performs well we dump our test data in the algorithms to predict and submit the competition. The code below, basically splits the train data into 4 parts, **X_train**, **X_test**, **y_train**, **y_test**.  \n* **X_train** and **y_train** first used to train the algorithm. \n* then, **X_test** is used in that trained algorithms to predict **outcomes. **\n* Once we get the **outcomes**, we compare it with **y_test**\n\nBy comparing the **outcome** of the model with **y_test**, we can determine whether our algorithms are performing well or not.

Feature Scaling\n<a id=\"feature_scaling\" ></a>\n***\nFeature scaling is an important concept of machine learning models. Often times a dataset contain features highly varying in magnitude and unit. For some machine learning models, it is not a problem. However, for many other ones, its quite a problem. Many machine learning algorithms uses euclidian distances to calculate the distance between two points, it is quite a problem.

The word **GridSearch** stands for the fact that we are searching for optimal parameter/parameters over a \"grid.\" These optimal parameters are also known as **Hyperparameters**. **The Hyperparameters are model parameters that are set before fitting the model and determine the behavior of the model.**. For example, when we choose to use linear regression, we may decide to add a penalty to the loss function such as Ridge or Lasso. These penalties require specific alpha (the strength of the regularization technique) to set beforehand. The higher the value of alpha, the more penalty is being added. GridSearch finds the optimal value of alpha among a range of values provided by us, and then we go on and use that optimal value to fit the model and get sweet results. It is essential to understand those model parameters are different from models outcomes, for example, **coefficients** or model evaluation metrics such as **accuracy score** or **mean squared error** are model outcomes and different than hyperparameters.\n\n#### This part of the kernel is a working progress.

But, how do we make sure that our model is performing well. Our model may be overfitting or underfitting. In fact, for those of you don't know what overfitting and underfitting is, Let's find out.\n\n![](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fittings.jpg)\n\nAs you see in the chart above. **Underfitting** is when the model fails to capture important aspects of the data and therefore introduces more bias and performs poorly. On the other hand, **Overfitting** is when the model performs too well on the training data but does poorly in the validation set or test sets.  This situation is also known as having less bias but more variation and perform poorly as well. Ideally, we want to configure a model that performs well not only in the training data but also in the test data. This is where **bias-variance tradeoff** comes in. When we have a model that overfits, meaning less biased and more of variance, we introduce some bias in exchange of having much less variance. One particular tactic for this task is regularization models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net).  These models are built to deal with the bias-variance tradeoff. This [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting) explains this topic well. Also, the following chart gives us a mental picture of where we want our models to be. \n![](http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/docs/BiasVariance/biasvariance.png)\n\nIdeally, we want to pick a sweet spot where the model performs well in training set, validation set, and test set. As the model gets complex, bias decreases, variance increases. However, the most critical part is the error rates. We want our models to be at the bottom of that **U** shape where the error rate is the least. That sweet spot is also known as **Optimum Model Complexity(OMC).**\n\nNow that we know what we want in terms of under-fitting and over-fitting, let's talk about how to combat them. \n\nHow to combat over-fitting?\n<ul>\n    <li>Simplify the model by using less parameters.</li>\n    <li>Simplify the model by changing the hyperparameters.</li>\n    <li>Introducing regularization models. </li>\n    <li>Use more training data. </li>\n    <li>Gatter more data ( and gather better quality data). </li>\n    </ul>\n #### This part of the kernel is a working progress.

(Pros and cons)</h3>\nBagging works best with strong and complex models(for example, fully developed decision trees). However, don't let that fool you to thinking that similar to a decision tree, bagging also overfits the model. Instead, bagging reduces overfitting since a lot of the sample training data are repeated and used to create base estimators. With a lot of equally likely training data, bagging is not very susceptible to overfitting with noisy data, therefore reduces variance. However, the downside is that this leads to an increase in bias."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"<h4>Random Forest VS. Bagging Classifier</h4>\n\nIf some of you are like me, you may find Random Forest to be similar to Bagging Classifier.

AdaBoost Classifier\n<a id=\"AdaBoost\"></a>\n***\nAdaBoost is another <b>ensemble model</b> and is quite different than Bagging. Let's point out the core concepts. \n> AdaBoost combines a lot of \"weak learners\"(they are also called stump; a tree with only one node and two leaves) to make classifications.\n\n> This base model fitting is an iterative process where each stump is chained one after the other; <b>It cannot run in parallel.</b>\n\n> <b>Some stumps get more say in the final classifications than others.</b> The models use weights that are assigned to each data point/raw indicating their \"importance.\" Samples with higher weight have a higher influence on the total error of the next model and gets more priority. The first stump starts with uniformly distributed weight which means, in the beginning, every datapoint have an equal amount of weights. \n\n> <b>Each stump is made by talking the previous stump's mistakes into account.</b> After each iteration weights gets re-calculated in order to take the errors/misclassifications from the last stump into consideration. \n\n> The final prediction is typically constructed by a weighted vote where weights for each base model depends on their training errors or misclassification rates. \n\nTo illustrate what we have talked about so far let's look at the following visualization. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*paPv7vXuq4eBHZY7.png\">\n<h5 align=\"right\"> Source: Diogo(Medium)</h5>\n\n\n\n\nLet's dive into each one of the nitty-gritty stuff about AdaBoost:\n***\n> <b>First</b>, we determine the best feature to split the dataset using Gini index(basics from decision tree). The feature with the lowest Gini index becomes the first stump in the AdaBoost stump chain(the lower the Gini index is, the better unmixed the label is, therefore, better split).\n***\n> <b>Secondly</b>, we need to determine how much say a stump will have in the final classification and how we can calculate that.\n* We learn how much say a stump has in the final classification by calculating how well it classified the samples (aka calculate the total error of the weight).\n* The <b>Total Error</b> for a stump is the sum of the weights associated with the incorrectly classified samples. For example, lets say, we start a stump with 10 datasets. The first stump will uniformly distribute an weight amoung all the datapoints. Which means each data point will have 1/10 weight. Let's say once the weight is distributed we run the model and find 2 incorrect predicitons. In order to calculate the total erorr we add up all the misclassified weights. Here we get 1/10 + 1/10 = 2/10 or 1/5. This is our total error. We can also think about it\n\n\n$$ \\epsilon_t = \\frac{\\text{misclassifications}_t}{\\text{observations}_t} $$\n\n\n* Since the weight is uniformly distributed(all add up to 1) among all data points, the total error will always be between 0(perfect stump) and 1(horrible stump).\n* We use the total error to determine the amount of say a stump has in the final classification using the following formula\n \n\n$$ \\alpha_t = \\frac{1}{2}ln \\left(\\frac{1-\\epsilon_t}{\\epsilon_t}\\right) \\text{where } \\epsilon_t < 1$$\n\n\nWhere $\\epsilon_t$ is the misclassification rate for the current classifier:\n\n\n$$ \\epsilon_t = \\frac{\\text{misclassifications}_t}{\\text{observations}_t} $$\n\n\nHere...\n* $\\alpha_t$ = Amount of Say\n* $\\epsilon_t$ = Total error\n\n\n\nWe can draw a graph to determine the amount of say using the value of total error(0 to 1)\n\n<img src=\"http://chrisjmccormick.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/adaboost_alphacurve.png\">\n<h5 align=\"right\"> Source: Chris McCormick</h5>\n\n* The blue line tells us the amount of say for <b>Total Error(Error rate)</b> between 0 and 1. \n* When the stump does a reasonably good job, and the <b>total error</b> is minimal, then the <b>amount of say(Alpha)</b> is relatively large, and the alpha value is positive. \n* When the stump does an average job(similar to a coin flip/the ratio of getting correct and incorrect ~50%/50%), then the <b>total error</b> is ~0.5. In this case the <b>amount of say</b> is <b>0</b>.\n* When the error rate is high let's say close to 1, then the <b>amount of say</b> will be negative, which means if the stump outputs a value as \"survived\" the included weight will turn that value into \"not survived.\"\n\nP.S. If the <b>Total Error</b> is 1 or 0, then this equation will freak out. A small amount of error is added to prevent this from happening. \n \n ***\n> <b>Third</b>, We need to learn how to modify the weights so that the next stump will take the errors that the current stump made into account. The pseducode for calculating the new sample weight is as follows. \n\n\n$$ New Sample Weight = Sample Weight + e^{\\alpha_t}$$\n\nHere the $\\alpha_t(AmountOfSay)$ can be positive or negative depending whether the sample was correctly classified or misclassified by the current stump. We want to increase the sample weight of the misclassified samples; hinting the next stump to put more emphasize on those. Inversely, we want to decrease the sample weight of the correctly classified samples; hinting the next stump to put less emphasize on those. \n\nThe following equation help us to do this calculation. \n\n$$ D_{t+1}(i) = D_t(i) e^{-\\alpha_t y_i h_t(x_i)} $$\n\nHere, \n* $D_{t+1}(i)$ = New Sample Weight. \n* $D_t(i)$ = Current Sample weight.\n* $\\alpha_t$ = Amount of Say, alpha value, this is the coefficient that gets updated in each iteration and \n* $y_i h_t(x_i)$ = place holder for 1 if stump correctly classified, -1 if misclassified. \n\nFinally, we put together the combined classifier, which is \n\n$$ AdaBoost(X) = sign\\left(\\sum_{t=1}^T\\alpha_t h_t(X)\\right) $$ \n\nHere, \n\n$AdaBoost(X)$ is the classification predictions for $y$ using predictor matrix $X$\n\n$T$ is the set of \"weak learners\"\n\n$\\alpha_t$ is the contribution weight for weak learner $t$\n\n$h_t(X)$ is the prediction of weak learner $t$\n\nand $y$ is binary **with values -1 and 1**\n\n\nP.S. Since the stump barely captures essential specs about the dataset, the model is highly biased in the beginning. However, as the chain of stumps continues and at the end of the process, AdaBoost becomes a strong tree and reduces both bias and variance.\n\n<h3>Resources:</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsK-xG1cLYA\">Statquest</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DUxtdeCiB4\">Principles of Machine Learning | AdaBoost(Video)</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":131,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T16:40:17.227822Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T16:40:17.227396Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.311627Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.311009Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T16:40:17.227656Z"}},"outputs":[],"source":"from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\nn_estimators = [100,140,145,150,160, 170,175,180,185];\ncv = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=10, test_size=.30, random_state=15)\nlearning_r = [0.1,1,0.01,0.5]\n\nparameters = {'n_estimators':n_estimators,\n              'learning_rate':learning_r\n              \n        }\ngrid = GridSearchCV(AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator= None, ## If None, then the base estimator is a decision tree.\n                                     ),\n                                 param_grid=parameters,\n                                 cv=cv,\n                                 n_jobs = -1)\ngrid.fit(X,y) "},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":132,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.313135Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.31287Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.318909Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.318191Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.313088Z"}},"outputs":[],"source":"print (grid.best_score_)\nprint (grid.best_params_)\nprint (grid.best_estimator_)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":133,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.320845Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.320267Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.35912Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.358535Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-26T16:41:28.320797Z"}},"outputs":[],"source":"adaBoost_grid = grid.best_estimator_\nadaBoost_grid.score(X,y)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Pros and cons of boosting\n\n---\n\n### Pros\n\n- Achieves higher performance than bagging when hyper-parameters tuned properly.\n- Can be used for classification and regression equally well.\n- Easily handles mixed data types.\n- Can use \"robust\" loss functions that make the model resistant to outliers.\n\n---\n\n### Cons\n\n- Difficult and time consuming to properly tune hyper-parameters.\n- Cannot be parallelized like bagging (bad scalability when huge amounts of data).\n- More risk of overfitting compared to bagging.\n\n<h3>Resources: </h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"http://mccormickml.com/2013/12/13/adaboost-tutorial/\">AdaBoost Tutorial-Chris McCormick</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://rob.schapire.net/papers/explaining-adaboost.pdf\">Explaining AdaBoost by Robert Schapire(One of the original author of AdaBoost)</a></li>\n</ul>"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6ea60e91-544f-49fc-8128-ee190e8292e7","_uuid":"860921893a28a1fe9a4ce47f0779f1e7b154ca0a"},"source":"## 7i.
