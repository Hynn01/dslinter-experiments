This is a competition that requires candidates to quantify the \"madness\" of this fascinating tournament. I'm pretty sure you've at least heard [\"March Madness\"](http://https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/bracketiq/2020-04-20/what-march-madness-ncaa-tournament-explained) when you are going to read my notebook. So now let me tell you what I am going to do in the rest of the notebook.\n\nMy **goal** is illustrating the Madness with multiple python libraries, such as [pandas](http://https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html), [matplotib](http://https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/index.html), [seaborn](http://https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [plotly](http://plotly.com/) at first, and then look deeper into the relationship between a team's performance between its efficiency and their key players between 2015-2018. So I am going to utilize to two significant meters: [Efficient Field Goal Percentage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_goal_percentage) (*abbr.* eFG%) and [Player Efficiency Rating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating) (*abbr.* PER) to respcectively measure the teams' and players' efficiency on the court. I am going to do my research entirely focused on the Men's performance, you can feel free and try it on the Women's. I'm sure that must be pretty similar.\n\nMost of my work will be based on the [provided data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-madness-analytics-2020/data) from the host. But I will also apply some [self-collected data](https://www.kaggle.com/anzhemeng/ncaa-d1-finalists-ever) to improvise my illustration.\n\nFor any other details of this wonderful tournament, please refer to NCAA on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association).\n\nAlright, time's up for warming up. It's the jump-ball whistle now!\n\n![NCAA logo](https://www.si.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MTcwNzM4MTI0MDIyODgzNTkw/ncaa-transfer-rule-name-image-likeness.webp)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id=\"chapter2\">2 Visual EDA</a>\n\nNow we are going to see what the data basically looks like by plotting some representative graphs.

So hopefully we can discover the connection between a team's overall performance and the most pivotal player's individual performance. In NBA, there has been a matured strategy to measure a player's contribution on the court, including +/- value and PER. Since what I desire is the player's efficiency, PER is more preferable choice. However, since the PER and created by [John Hollinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hollinger) and utilized by NBA is a very complex stuff. In the following part of this chapter, I am going to implement a rough PER formula.\n\nI call this PER \"pure PER\" because it merely cares about the most basic statistics and does not involve any complicated calculation.
