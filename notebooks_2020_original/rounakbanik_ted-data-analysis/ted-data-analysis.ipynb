As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan and Bill Gates.\n\nTed, which operates under the slogan 'Ideas worth spreading' has managed to achieve an incredible feat of bringing world renowned experts from various walks of life and study and giving them a platform to distill years of their work and research into talks of 18 minutes in length. What's even more incredible is that their invaluable insights is available on the Internet for free.\n\nSince the time I begin watching TED Talks in high school, they have never ceased to amaze me. I have learned an incredible amount, about fields I was completely alien to, in the form of poignant stories, breathtaking visuals and subtle humor. So in this notebook, I wanted to attempt at finding insights about the world of TED, its speakers and its viewers and try to answer a few questions that I had always had in the back of my mind.","cell_type":"markdown"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"81d127aa-551f-4fdb-98fb-8dca2d2faea1","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"f5aee6a6d370cdfcfecf9d4d2f3d65445be12b0b"},"source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport json\nfrom pandas.io.json import json_normalize\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9b5a1aee-5f65-4330-98c7-fec99eadec2f","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"4d28c92cf4f9819412d6f1280193f6f349dd9aaa"},"source":"month_order = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']\nday_order = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0fdd99e6-e0a7-497f-bdd0-346e333f3cda","_uuid":"b388e751b5b37848577c772746edff862d1a8611"},"source":"The data has been obtained by running a custom web scraper on the official TED.com website.
