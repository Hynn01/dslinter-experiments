In my first notebook ( [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/) ), I attempted at narrating the story of film by performing an extensive exploratory data analysis on Movies Metadata collected from TMDB. I also built two extremely minimalist predictive models to predict movie revenue and movie success and visualise which features influence the output (revenue and success respectively).\n\nIn this notebook, I will attempt at implementing a few recommendation algorithms (content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering) and try to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system. With us, we have two MovieLens datasets.\n\n* **The Full Dataset:** Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.\n* **The Small Dataset:** Comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.\n\nI will build a Simple Recommender using movies from the *Full Dataset* whereas all personalised recommender systems will make use of the small dataset (due to the computing power I possess being very limited). As a first step, I will build my simple recommender system.","metadata":{"_uuid":"c9e02ccf7a6f04280a8a949fe82cc3c12f8a769f","_cell_guid":"351091d0-4223-4510-b737-3d109883c4bf"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom ast import literal_eval\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel, cosine_similarity\nfrom nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer\nfrom nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom nltk.corpus import wordnet\nfrom surprise import Reader, Dataset, SVD, evaluate\n\nimport warnings; warnings.simplefilter('ignore')","metadata":{"_uuid":"1c291fe3725c706e0003f01f0102abb9709f25fc","_cell_guid":"78fea705-f9ad-4a81-aafd-8b7b624110d1","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code"},{"source":"## Simple Recommender\n\nThe Simple Recommender offers generalized recommnendations to every user based on movie popularity and (sometimes) genre.

One startling feature of this recommender system is that it doesn't care what the movie is (or what it contains). It works purely on the basis of an assigned movie ID and tries to predict ratings based on how the other users have predicted the movie.","metadata":{"_uuid":"ba08a1dc335c8662f4bec66cec36fef04b2c63b5","_cell_guid":"42878787-6661-4d30-b58a-c5408e683157"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Hybrid Recommender\n\n![](https://www.toonpool.com/user/250/files/hybrid_20095.jpg)","metadata":{"_uuid":"b6fe882ef8417e28bb024306a3879dc67affb7c6","_cell_guid":"248ec145-20e4-429c-8718-5c20834be1be"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"In this section, I will try to build a simple hybrid recommender that brings together techniques we have implemented in the content based and collaborative filter based engines.

They are as follows:\n\n1. **Simple Recommender:** This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.\n2. **Content Based Recommender:** We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also deviced a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.\n3. **Collaborative Filtering:** We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.\n4. **Hybrid Engine:** We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filterting to build an engine that gave movie suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.\n\nPrevious -> [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/)","metadata":{"_uuid":"ad1edcae8eecd5c725edbe18082bc4d8103ca800","_cell_guid":"812fc4c7-b334-4f54-a05f-8fc0e7962a92"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"e53889f19f6d352bb0418567941dff8f9e57da41","_cell_guid":"304b0809-4070-4954-99ed-203a4b8b6956","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code"}],"nbformat_minor":1,"nbformat":4,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","mimetype":"text/x-python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.3"}}}
