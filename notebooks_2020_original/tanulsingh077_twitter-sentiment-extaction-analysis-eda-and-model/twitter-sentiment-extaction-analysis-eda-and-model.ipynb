Can You?. <b>Sentiment analysis</b> is for NLP <b>'what Happy Birthday to You'</b> is for Guitar players Right? You start here <br>\n<br>\nIn case you are not aware about sentiment analysis here is a very good article : https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-concept-analysis-and-applications-6c94d6f58c17\n<br><br>\nRecently Kaggle Lauched a new competition admist the COVID-19 Scare , named Twitter Sentiment Extraction ,I know right its a twitter sentiment analysis competition,But kaggle never disappoints you,it could not have been this straightforward, afterall it has go on for two months.So what this competition asks for is not the sentiment scores but the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment., Interesting it isn't it? This competition is special,so if you want to level up your NLP skills , this competition is for you\n\n# Acknowledgements\n* https://www.kaggle.com/aashita/word-clouds-of-various-shapes --> WORDCLOUDS FUNCTION\n* https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsingh9990/ner-training-using-spacy-0-628-lb --> For understanding how to train spacy NER on custom inputs\n\n\n# About this Notebook\n\nIn this kernel, I will briefly explain the structure of dataset.I will generate and analyze metafeatures. Then, I will visualize the dataset using Matplotlib, seaborn and Plotly to gain as much insight as I can . Also I will approach this problem as an NER problem to build a model\n<br><br>\nIn case you are just starting with NLP here is a guide to Approach almost any NLP Problem by Grandmaster @Abhishek Thakur\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/abhishekkrthakur/approaching-almost-any-nlp-problem\n\n\n<b> This kernel is a work in Progress,and I will keep on updating it as the competition progresses and I learn more and more things about the data</b>\n\n**<span style=\"color:Red\">If you find this kernel useful, Please Upvote it , it motivates me to write more Quality content**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Necesseties "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\nimport string\nimport numpy as np \nimport random\nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom plotly import graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator\n\n\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport os\nimport nltk\nimport spacy\nimport random\nfrom spacy.util import compounding\nfrom spacy.util import minibatch\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Below is a helper Function which generates random colors which can be used to give different colors to your plots.Feel free to use it**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def random_colours(number_of_colors):\n    '''\n    Simple function for random colours generation.\n    Input:\n        number_of_colors -

participating in and this might be the case with lot of us.Due to the unique structure of the problem statement, it is hard for any first timer or a competitions noob to answer the question\"Which Model to Use\"?.My initial thoughts was this competition is not for me and I am done here,but then I remembered something, I was at the KaggleDays Meetup Delhi this year and I had this wonderful oppurtunity to meet Grandmaster Abhishek Thakur and during the Q&A session I asked him that kaggle competitions are so diverse ,unique ,require a lot of background knowledge and thus is scary to participate, to which he replied and I quote \"Scary Yes!But so is walking into a dark room,you will never learn if you won't participate\".\n\nSo here I am fighting my way through this competition and trying to learn different things and I urge everyone to do the same , I might not be so well established to give advices but I really wanted to share that story to motivate people.\n\nAfter going through the discussion forums,taking advices from experts and watching Abhishek Sir's tutorial last night ,this problem can be modelled as following:-\n* Named Entity Recognition\n* Q&A Problem\n* I also found a simple approach shared by Nick in his beautiful kernel where he has the concept of Gini Impurity to give weights to words present in tweets and then predicting using the weight of those words : https://www.kaggle.com/nkoprowicz/a-simple-solution-using-only-word-counts/notebook .Do check it out.\n* Other Modelling Ideas :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/discussion/139803 --> Here is a very Nice Idea\n* Another useful Idea :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/discussion/139335\n\nResources :\n* For Modelling Problem as NER : https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsingh9990/ner-training-using-spacy-0-628-lb\n* For Modelling Problem AS Q&A : https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/question-answering-starter-pack ---> This is a complete Guide and From scratch"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1)Modelling the Problem as NER\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a standard NLP problem which involves spotting named entities (people, places, organizations etc.) from a chunk of text, and classifying them into a predefined set of categories.\nFor understanding NER here is very good article : https://towardsdatascience.com/named-entity-recognition-with-nltk-and-spacy-8c4a7d88e7da\n\nWe will be using spacy for creating our own customised NER model or models (seperate for each Sentiment).The motivation for this approach is off course the kernel shared by Rohit Singh,so if you find his kernel useful please upvote it.\n\nWhat will be different with my solution:\n* I will use text as selected_text for all neutral tweets due to their high jaccard similarity\n* Also I will use text as selected_text for all tweets having number of words less than 3 in text as explained before\n* I will train two different models for Positive and Negtive tweets\n* I will not preprocess the data because the selected text contains raw text"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/tweet-sentiment-extraction/train.csv')\ndf_test =
