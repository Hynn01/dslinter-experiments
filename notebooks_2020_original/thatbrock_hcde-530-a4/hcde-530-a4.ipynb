You need to get the geolocation and weather for each item and store it in the same (or a new) dictionary. You then print out the data and format it to be pretty (whatever that means to you) and finally, write it out as a json file with a timestamp.\n\n**You will need to enable Internet connections in the sidebar to the right of your notebook. If you get a `Connection error` in the Console, it is because your notebook can't access the internet.**\n\nYou will access two different APIs to get this information:\n1. OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/api) which is a reverse-geocoding API (you provide them a location and they give your it's geo-coordinates in Lat and Lon)\n2. Openweathermap API (https://openweathermap.org/api)\n\nNote: You can get LAT and LON from Openweathermap, but for this assignment, you should get them from OpenCage.\n\n### Step 1: Accessing APIs to retrieve data\nFirst, you will need to request an API Secret Key from OpenCage (https://opencagedata.com/api) and add it to your Kaggle notebook in the Add-ons menu item. Once you have the Secret Key, you attach it to this notebook (click the checkbox) so you can make the API call. Make sure the **Label** for your key in your Kaggle Secrets file is what you use in your code below.\n\nYou will also an API Secret Key from OpenWeatherMapAPI (https://openweathermap.org/api). Attach it to this notebook and use it in the code. Make sure you have created different labels for each key and use them in the code below. You can see how to make calls to the API here: https://openweathermap.org/current\n\nFinally, make sure to install the `opencage` module in this notebook. Use the console at the bottom of the window and type `pip install opencage`. You should receive a confirmation message if it installs successfully.\n\nThen try running the code cells below to see the output. Once the code sucessfully works for Seattle (which has been provided for you below), try typing in different cities instead to see the results to make sure it is working.\n\n### Step 2: Retreiving values for each city in your dictionary\nIn the code cell below, add some code to try to get information for all of the cities in your `citytracker` dictionary. You can print the information out to make sure it is working. Store the results of `getForecast` for each city in your dictionary.\n\n### Step 3: Writing the datafile\nSave the results of your work as a JSON formatted output file in your Kaggle output folder and Commit your notebook. Make sure to make it public and submit the resulting URL in Canvas.
