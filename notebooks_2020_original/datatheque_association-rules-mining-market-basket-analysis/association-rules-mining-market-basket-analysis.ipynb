However, I quickly discovered that it's not part of the standard Python machine learning libraries.  Although there are some implementations that exist, I could not find one capable of handling large datasets.  \"Large\" in my case was an orders dataset with 32 million records, containing 3.2 million unique orders and about 50K unique items (file size just over 1 GB).  So, I decided to write my own implementation, leveraging the apriori algorithm to generate simple {A} -> {B} association rules. Since I only care about understanding relationships between any given pair of items, using apriori to get to item sets of size 2 is sufficient.  I went through various iterations, splitting the data into multiple subsets just so I could get functions like crosstab and combinations to run on my machine with 8 GB of memory.  :)  But even with this approach, I could only process about 1800 items before my kernel would crash...  And that's when I learned about the wonderful world of Python generators.\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"aa1d4de4449ca66d8d315d8df6d20fc12c4f82e7","_cell_guid":"7cf99a98-f1f2-4666-a39e-aa923c3a0c07"},"source":"### Python Generators\n\nIn a nutshell, a generator is a special type of function that returns an iterable sequence of items.  However, unlike regular functions which return all the values at once (eg: returning all the elements of a list), a generator <i>yields</i> one value at a time.  To get the next value in the set, we must ask for it - either by explicitly calling the generator's built-in \"next\" method, or implicitly via a for loop.  This is a great property of generators because it means that we don't have to store all of the values in memory at once.  We can load and process one value at a time, discard when finished and move on to process the next value.  This feature makes generators perfect for creating item pairs and counting their frequency of co-occurence.  Here's a concrete example of what we're trying to accomplish:  \n\n1. Get all possible item pairs for a given order \n       eg:  order 1:  apple, egg, milk   -->  item pairs: {apple, egg}, {apple, milk}, {egg, milk}\n            order 2:  egg, milk          -->  item pairs: {egg, milk}\n            \n2. Count the number of times each item pair appears\n       eg: {apple, egg}: 1\n           {apple, milk}: 1\n           {egg, milk}: 2\n\nHere's the generator that implements the above tasks:"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"_uuid":"a16756678652a9f0108e88c238bd23ca6658e0ab","collapsed":true,"_cell_guid":"cac0e787-9263-4d31-b070-eb1742928782"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nfrom itertools import combinations, groupby\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Sample data\norders = np.array([[1,'apple'], [1,'egg'], [1,'milk'], [2,'egg'], [2,'milk']], dtype=object)\n\n# Generator that yields item pairs, one at a time\ndef get_item_pairs(order_item):\n    \n    # For each order, generate a list of items in that order\n    for order_id, order_object in groupby(orders, lambda x: x[0]):\n        item_list = [item[1] for item in order_object]      \n    \n        # For each item list, generate item pairs, one at a time\n        for item_pair in combinations(item_list, 2):\n            yield item_pair                                      \n\n\n# Counter iterates through the item pairs returned by our generator and keeps a tally of their occurrence\nCounter(get_item_pairs(orders))\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"f9359858a4df545cb88f989cce45092a3a89df2b","_cell_guid":"73cd2676-7749-47c3-b9c9-0da9c93c0790"},"source":"<i>get_item_pairs()</i> generates a list of items for each order and produces item pairs for that order, one pair at a time.

It does so using a \"bottom up\" approach, first identifying individual items that satisfy a minimum occurence threshold. It then extends the item set, adding one item at a time and checking if the resulting item set still satisfies the specified threshold.  The algorithm stops when there are no more items to add that meet the minimum occurrence requirement.

Given that we are only looking at item sets of size 2, the association rules we will generate will be of the form {A} -> {B}.  One common application of these rules is in the domain of recommender systems, where customers who purchased item A are recommended item B.\n\nHere are 3 key metrics to consider when evaluating association rules:\n\n1. <b>support</b>  \n    This is the percentage of orders that contains the item set. In the example above, there are 5 orders in total \n    and {apple,egg} occurs in 3 of them, so: \n       \n                    support{apple,egg} = 3/5 or 60%\n        \n    The minimum support threshold required by apriori can be set based on knowledge of your domain.  In this \n    grocery dataset for example, since there could be thousands of distinct items and an order can contain \n    only a small fraction of these items, setting the support threshold to 0.01% may be reasonable.<br><br><br>\n    \n2. <b>confidence</b>  \n    Given two items, A and B, confidence measures the percentage of times that item B is purchased, given that \n    item A was purchased. This is expressed as:\n       \n                    confidence{A->B} = support{A,B} / support{A}   \n                    \n    Confidence values range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that B is never purchased when A is purchased, and 1 \n    indicates that B is always purchased whenever A is purchased.  Note that the confidence measure is directional.     This means that we can also compute the percentage of times that item A is purchased, given that item B was \n    purchased:\n       \n                    confidence{B->A} = support{A,B} / support{B}    \n                    \n    In our example, the percentage of times that egg is purchased, given that apple was purchased is:  \n       \n                    confidence{apple->egg} = support{apple,egg} / support{apple}\n                                           = (3/5) / (4/5)\n                                           = 0.75 or 75%\n\n    A confidence value of 0.75 implies that out of all orders that contain apple, 75% of them also contain egg.  Now, \n    we look at the confidence measure in the opposite direction (ie: egg->apple): \n       \n                    confidence{egg->apple} = support{apple,egg} / support{egg}\n                                           = (3/5) / (3/5)\n                                           = 1 or 100%  \n                                           \n    Here we see that all of the orders that contain egg also contain apple.  But, does this mean that there is a \n    relationship between these two items, or are they occurring together in the same orders simply by chance?  To \n    answer this question, we look at another measure which takes into account the popularity of <i>both</i> items.<br><br><br>  \n    \n3. <b>lift</b>  \n    Given two items, A and B, lift indicates whether there is a relationship between A and B, or whether the two items \n    are occuring together in the same orders simply by chance (ie: at random).  Unlike the confidence metric whose \n    value may vary depending on direction (eg: confidence{A->B} may be different from confidence{B->A}), \n    lift has no direction. This means that the lift{A,B} is always equal to the lift{B,A}: \n       \n                    lift{A,B} = lift{B,A} = support{A,B} / (support{A} * support{B})   \n    \n    In our example, we compute lift as follows:\n    \n         lift{apple,egg} = lift{egg,apple} = support{apple,egg} / (support{apple} * support{egg})\n                         = (3/5) / (4/5 * 3/5) \n                         = 1.25    \n               \n    One way to understand lift is to think of the denominator as the likelihood that A and B will appear in the same \n    order if there was <i>no</i> relationship between them. In the example above, if apple occurred in 80% of the\n    orders and egg occurred in 60% of the orders, then if there was no relationship between them, we would \n    <i>expect</i> both of them to show up together in the same order 48% of the time (ie: 80% * 60%).  The numerator, \n    on the other hand, represents how often apple and egg <i>actually</i> appear together in the same order.  In \n    this example, that is 60% of the time.  Taking the numerator and dividing it by the denominator, we get to how \n    many more times apple and egg actually appear in the same order, compared to if there was no relationship between     them (ie: that they are occurring together simply at random).  \n    \n    In summary, lift can take on the following values:\n    \n        * lift = 1 implies no relationship between A and B. \n          (ie: A and B occur together only by chance)\n      \n        * lift > 1 implies that there is a positive relationship between A and B.\n          (ie:  A and B occur together more often than random)\n    \n        * lift < 1 implies that there is a negative relationship between A and B.\n          (ie:  A and B occur together less often than random)\n        \n    In our example, apple and egg occur together 1.25 times <i>more</i> than random, so we conclude that there exists \n    a positive relationship between them.\n   \nArmed with knowledge of apriori and association rules mining, let's dive into the data and code to see what relationships we unravel!"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"338d54d8ba644a93dd8d5076d5edf3fa24121006","_cell_guid":"719e883c-03f3-4fb1-90e3-fd99855ff022"},"source":"### Input Dataset\nInstacart, an online grocer, has graciously made some of their datasets accessible to the public.

Once item pairs have been identified as having positive relationship, recommendations can be made to customers in order to increase sales.  And hopefully, along the way, also introduce customers to items they never would have tried before or even imagined existed!"}]}
