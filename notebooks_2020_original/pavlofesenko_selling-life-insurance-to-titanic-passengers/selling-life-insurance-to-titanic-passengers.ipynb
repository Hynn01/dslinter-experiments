Problem description\n\nImagine that you have to decide whether to sell life insurances to the Titanic passengers and you know in advance that the ship is going to sink. Moreover, you have somehow obtained the anonymized features of the victims and survivors.\n\n> *Could you minimize the number of insurance claims from the victims and at the same time maximize the total number of insurances that are sold to the passengers*?\n\nThis approach could be, for example, used by the insurance agencies that sell life insurances for high-risk clients with high-risk profession, habits, diseases, etc."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9abde72048a1bba25cb9dbebcfc1cc82695f51d1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. How is this problem different from the regular classification?\n\n<img align=\"right\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Precisionrecall.svg/350px-Precisionrecall.svg.png\">\n\nLet's have a look at the results of the classification model that will be further described in Part 4:\n* Correct predictions: 177 (survivors 61, victims 116)\n* Wrong predictions: 46 (survivors 23, victims 23)\n\nThe overall accuracy score of this model seems to be quite good 177 / (177 + 46) = 0.79 but is it also good for our particular problem?\n\nNote that this model has wrongly predicted 23 survivors (that actually died) meaning that the insurance agency has sold them insurances and now has to pay 23 insurance claims to the relatives of these victims. This is a huge cost! Ideally we want the number of wrongly predicted survivors to be 0. This type of wrong predictions is called *false positives* (see the figure on the right, cited from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall)).\n\nOn the other hand, the model has wrongly predicted 23 victims (that actually survived) meaning that the agency hasn't sold 23 insurances to these people and lost potential customers. Nevertheless, this loss is significantly lower compared to the previous one since the cost of the insurance package is typically much lower than the cost of the insurance claim. This type of wrong predictions is called *false negatives* (see the figure).\n\nTo conclude, the incurance agency would prefer to **minimize the number of false positives** even if it might increase the number of false negatives.\n\nFor this purpose we will use the concepts of *precision* and *recall* that are defined below in the figure. As one can see from this definitions, **maximizing the precision minimizes the number of false positives**.\n\nBut how do we adjust our model to maximize the precision of the survivors? To make the long story short, we will need to adjust the threshold for class probabilities predicted by our model using a *Precision-Recall (or PR) curve*.

Training the model and adjusting precision\n\nAs mentioned in the Part 1, to minimize the insurance claims from the victims we need to minimize the number of false positive errors or equivalently maximize the precision. This statement is obvious from the definition of the latter\n\n$$ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{true positives}}{\\text{true positives + false positives}} $$.\n\nIn order to avoid false positives when predicting survived passengers, the classification threshold needs to clearly separate the training group of died passengers (true negatives or TN) from the rest (see the figure A below, cited from [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-a-classifier-in-scikit-learn-66e048c21e65)).\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*J8kWRRekByVSJi8XDTSsgw.jpeg\">\n\nFor example, for classification models that use a logistic loss function, this is a probability threshold (0.5 by default) for the outcome probabilities predicted by the model. If the predicted probability is higher than this threshold, the object is considered to be class \"1\" (survived passengers), otherwise the object is labeled to be class \"0\" (died passengers). To maximize the precision of survived passengers, the probability threshold needs to be much closer to 1.0 so that we only predict the survival of the passengers when the model thinks they have very high chances.\n\nVariation of the classification threshold changes not only precision but also recall. To visualize these changes data scientists make a *Precision-Recall (or PR) curve*. Using this curve we can identify the point of maximum precision and the corresponding threshold.\n\nFor this problem I have chosen the classifier based on *stochastic gradient descent (or SGD)* with a logistic loss function. SGD is typically used for much larger datasets so other algorithms (for example, logistic regression) would be more appropriate here. However, SGD was one of the first classification algorithms that I learned and it is also great to demonstrate the importance of scaling the numeric features mentioned in Part 3."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c81c88c4cd7ecc0e86c5e36f3ef30534e57a0ea7"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fitting the model and printing the accuracy score\nmodel = linear_model.SGDClassifier(loss='log', max_iter=2000, random_state=0) # Random state is fixed for reproducibility\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\nmetrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0ea4ae7a41789bbe42b0da0ab24234812e8ac8fc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since SGD calculates the gradient only of the random part of the dataset (hence the name \"stochastic\"), the accuracy score might decrease after some of the iterations.

On the plot below the model converged after 1500 iterations so this or higher value should be used for the maximum number of iterations. Above we used 2000 iterations so it should suffice.\n\n**Try it yourself:** Scaling of the numeric features helps a lot with the convergence of the SGD classifier. Try to comment the code that does scaling and rerun all the cells. You will see that the convergence doesn't occur. In this case you need to set the parameter `learning_rate='constant'` and manually decrease the parameter `eta0` until the convergence occurs again."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"20a99b03461c50a4e304da8c8a6895955e8db022"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Checking the convergence of the model\nn_iter = np.linspace(1, 3000)\nscores = np.array([])\nfor n in n_iter:\n    model = linear_model.SGDClassifier(loss='log', max_iter=n, random_state=0)\n    model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    scores = np.append(scores, model.score(X_test, y_test))\n    \nplt.plot(n_iter, scores)\nplt.xlabel('Number of iterations')\nplt.ylabel('Accuracy')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9b3cacc2842c1369a8ad1e160e3d0b3a9f1bd290"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now that the convergence is confirmed, let's calculate the confusion matrix of our model.
