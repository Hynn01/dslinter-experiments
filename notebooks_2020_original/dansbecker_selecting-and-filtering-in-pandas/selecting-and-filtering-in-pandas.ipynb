How can you pare down this overwhelming amount of data to something you can understand?\n\nTo show you the techniques, we'll start by picking a few variables using our intuition. Later tutorials will show you statistical techniques to  automatically prioritize variables.\n\nBefore we can choose variables/columns, it is helpful to see a list of all columns in the dataset. That is done with the **columns** property of the DataFrame (the bottom line of code below)."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f1f8ee3e-acfd-40cf-8a22-6ece9b38a1ab","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"403f263694c540d758d4cf9c61e606976da501b3","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\nmelbourne_file_path = '../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv'\nmelbourne_data = pd.read_csv(melbourne_file_path) \nprint(melbourne_data.columns)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c90db33f-6c6e-419e-9ec9-f9905064895d","_uuid":"38785578a3b8c087338e1a147cbba99b6c4e865f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are many ways to select a subset of your data.
