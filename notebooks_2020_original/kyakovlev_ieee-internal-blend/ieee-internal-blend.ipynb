Minify Data \n> https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-data-minification\n\n\nStep: 2. Make ground baseline with no fe:\n> https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-ground-baseline and \n> https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-ground-baseline-deeper-learning\n\n\nStep: 3. Make a small FE and see I you can understand data you have\n>  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-ground-baseline-make-amount-useful-again and\n>  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-gb-2-make-amount-useful-again\n\n\nStep: 4. Find good CV strategy \n>  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-cv-options\nand same with gap to compare results (gap in values is what we have in test set)\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-cv-options-with-gap\n\nStep: 4(1). Groupkfold (by timeblocks) application\n> https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-lgbm-with-groupkfold-cv\n\n\nStep: 5. Try different set of features\n>  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-experimental\n\n\nStep: 6. Make deeper FE (brute force option)\n> https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-fe-with-some-eda\n\n\nStep: 7. Features selection (missing kernel here, I'll post later)\n\n\nStep: 8. Hyperopt (missing kernel here, I'll post later)\n\n\nStep: 9. Try other models (XGBoost, CatBoost, NN - missing kernel here, I'll post later)\n> CatBoost (with categorical transformations)  https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-catboost-baseline-with-groupkfold-cv\n\nStep: 10. Try blending and stacking (missing kernel here, I'll post later)\n\n---\n\n(Utils)\n\nSome tricks that where used in fe kernel\n> https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-small-tricks\n\nPart of EDA (Just few things)\n> https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-check-noise and https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/ieee-simple-eda\n\n---\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/104142"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# General imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os, sys, gc, warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"########################### DATA LOAD/MIX/EXPORT\n#################################################################################\n# Simple lgbm (0.0948)\nsub_1 = pd.read_csv('../input/ieee-simple-lgbm/submission.csv')\n\n# Blend of two kernels with old features (0.9468)\nsub_2 = pd.read_csv('../input/ieee-cv-options/submission.csv')\n\n# Add new features lgbm with CV (0.09485)\nsub_3 = pd.read_csv('../input/ieee-lgbm-with-groupkfold-cv/submission.csv')\n\n# Add catboost (0.09407)\nsub_4 = pd.read_csv('../input/ieee-catboost-baseline-with-groupkfold-cv/submission.csv')\n\nsub_1['isFraud'] += sub_2['isFraud']\nsub_1['isFraud'] += sub_3['isFraud']\nsub_1['isFraud'] += sub_4['isFraud']\n\nsub_1.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
