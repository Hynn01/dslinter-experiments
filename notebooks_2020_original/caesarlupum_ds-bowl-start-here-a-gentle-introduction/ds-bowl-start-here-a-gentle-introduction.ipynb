Ignite Possibilities.\nUncover new insights in early childhood education and how media can support learning outcomes. Participate in our fifth annual Data Science Bowl, presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle.\n\nPBS KIDS, a trusted name in early childhood education for decades, aims to gain insights into how media can help children learn important skills for success in school and life. In this challenge, you’ll use anonymous gameplay data, including knowledge of videos watched and games played, from the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, a game-based learning tool developed as a part of the CPB-PBS Ready To Learn Initiative with funding from the U.S. Department of Education. Competitors will be challenged to predict scores on in-game assessments and create an algorithm that will lead to better-designed games and improved learning outcomes. Your solutions will aid in discovering important relationships between engagement with high-quality educational media and learning processes.\n\n##### Data Science Bowl is the world’s largest data science competition focused on social good. Each year, this competition gives Kagglers a chance to use their passion to change the world. Over the last four years, more than 50,000+ Kagglers have submitted over 114,000+ submissions, to improve everything from lung cancer and heart disease detection to ocean health.\n\n> For more information on the Data Science Bowl, please visit [DataScienceBowl.com](DataScienceBowl.com)\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=UserWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=FutureWarning)\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\nHTML('<iframe width=\"1100\" height=\"619\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/45Da3eqQKXQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>')\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.166114Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.166693Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.177494Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.166644Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.176469Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### <a id='1'>Where does the data for the competition come from?</a>\n<a href= '#1'> Top</a>\n\nThe data used in this competition is anonymous, tabular data of interactions with the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app. Select data, such as a user’s in-app assessment score or their path through the game, is collected by the PBS KIDS Measure Up! app, a game-based learning tool.\n\nPBS KIDS is committed to creating a safe and secure environment that family members of all ages can enjoy. The PBS KIDS Measure Up! app does not collect any personally identifying information, such as name or location. All of the data used in the competition is anonymous.

Each assessment is designed to test a child's comprehension of a certain set of measurement-related skills. There are five assessments: Bird Measurer, Cart Balancer, Cauldron Filler, Chest Sorter, and Mushroom Sorter.\n\nThe intent of the competition is to use the gameplay data to forecast how many attempts a child will take to pass a given assessment (an incorrect answer is counted as an attempt). Each application install is represented by an installation_id. This will typically correspond to one child, but you should expect noise from issues such as shared devices. In the training set, you are provided the full history of gameplay data. In the test set, we have truncated the history after the start event of a single assessment, chosen randomly, for which you must predict the number of attempts. Note that the training set contains many installation_ids which never took assessments, whereas every installation_id in the test set made an attempt on at least one assessment.\n\n#####  The outcomes in this competition are grouped into 4 groups (labeled accuracy_group in the data):\n\n- 3: the assessment was solved on the first attempt\n- 2: the assessment was solved on the second attempt\n- 1: the assessment was solved after 3 or more attempts\n- 0: the assessment was never solved\n> The file train_labels.csv has been provided to show how these groups would be computed on the assessments in the training set. Assessment attempts are captured in event_code 4100 for all assessments except for Bird Measurer, which uses event_code 4110. If the attempt was correct, it contains \"correct\":true.\n\n> Note that this is a synchronous rerun code competition and the private test set has approximately 8MM rows. You should be mindful of memory in your notebooks to avoid submission errors.\n\n### Files\n\n- train.csv & test.csv\n\nThese are the main data files which contain the gameplay events.\n\n- event_id - Randomly generated unique identifier for the event type. Maps to event_id column in specs table.\n- game_session - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping events within a single game or video play session.\n- timestamp - Client-generated datetime\n- event_data - Semi-structured JSON formatted string containing the events parameters. Default fields are: event_count, event_code, and - - game_time; otherwise fields are determined by the event type.\n- installation_id - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping game sessions within a single installed application instance.\n- event_count - Incremental counter of events within a game session (offset at 1). Extracted from event_data.\n- event_code - Identifier of the event 'class'. Unique per game, but may be duplicated across games. E.g. event code '2000' always - - - - identifies the 'Start Game' event for all games. Extracted from event_data.\n- game_time - Time in milliseconds since the start of the game session. Extracted from event_data.\n- title - Title of the game or video.\n- type - Media type of the game or video. Possible values are: 'Game', 'Assessment', 'Activity', 'Clip'.\n- world - The section of the application the game or video belongs to. Helpful to identify the educational curriculum goals of the media. Possible values are: 'NONE' (at the app's start screen), TREETOPCITY' (Length/Height), 'MAGMAPEAK' (Capacity/Displacement), 'CRYSTALCAVES' (Weight).\n- specs.csv\n\n##### This file gives the specification of the various event types.\n\n- event_id - Global unique identifier for the event type. Joins to event_id column in events table.\n- info - Description of the event.\n- args - JSON formatted string of event arguments. Each argument contains:\n- name - Argument name.\n- type - Type of the argument (string, int, number, object, array).\n- info - Description of the argument.\n- train_labels.csv\n\n###### This file demonstrates how to compute the ground truth for the assessments in the training set.\n\n- sample_submission.csv\nA sample submission in the correct format.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n<html>\n<body>\n\n<p><font size=\"5\" color=\"Purple\">If you find this kernel useful or interesting, please don't forget to upvote the kernel =)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Imports\n\n> We are using a typical data science stack: `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# matplotlib and seaborn for plotting\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\n\nfrom plotly import tools, subplots\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.express as px\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100)\n\n\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot\n\n\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook\n\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.rc('figure', figsize=(15.0, 8.0))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.17912Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.179534Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.728861Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-23T16:19:33.179476Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.728004Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id='3'>3.

Some [general interpretations of the absolute value of the correlation coefficent](http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/pearsons.pdf) are:\n\n\n* .00-.19 “very weak”\n*  .20-.39 “weak”\n*  .40-.59 “moderate”\n*  .60-.79 “strong”\n* .80-1.0 “very strong”\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> ### Train Correlation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"corrs = train.corr()\ncorrs","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.967945Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.968465Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize = (20, 8))\n\n# Heatmap of correlations\nsns.heatmap(corrs, cmap = plt.cm.RdYlBu_r, vmin = -0.25, annot = True, vmax = 0.6)\nplt.title('Correlation Heatmap');","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.969496Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.970076Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> ### Train_labels Correlation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"corrs2 = train_labels.corr()\ncorrs2","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.971156Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.971529Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize = (20, 8))\n\n# Heatmap of correlations\nsns.heatmap(corrs2, cmap = plt.cm.RdYlBu_r, vmin = -0.25, annot = True, vmax = 0.6)\nplt.title('Correlation Heatmap');","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.972506Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-23T16:19:35.973103Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <a id='10'>10.
