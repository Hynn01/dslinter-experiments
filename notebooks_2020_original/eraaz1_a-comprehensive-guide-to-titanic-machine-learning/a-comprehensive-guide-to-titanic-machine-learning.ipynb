It looks at the range of values, as well as the central tendency of the values. Univariate data analysis does not look at relationships between various variables (like bivariate and multivariate analysis) rather it summarises each variable on its own. Methods to perform univariate analysis will depend on whether the variable is categorical or numerical. For numerical variable, we would explore its shape of distribution (distribution can either be symmetric or skewed) using histogram and density plots. For categorical variables, we would use bar plots to visualize the absolute and proportional frequency distribution.

By now, we should have a good idea about the distribution of the variables and the presence of outliers in those variables. For categorical variables mode-imputation is performed and for numerical variable mean-impuation is performed if its distribution is symmetric(or almost symmetric or normal like Age). On the other hand, for a variable with skewed distribution and outliers (like Fare), meadian-imputation is recommended as median is more immune to outliers than mean. \n\nHowever, one clear disadvantage of using mean, median or mode to impute missing values is the addition of bias if the amount of missing values is significant (like Age). So simply replacing them with the mean or the median age might not be the best solution since the age may differ by groups and categories of passengers.\n\nTo solve this, we can group our data by some variables that have no missing values and for each subset compute the median age to impute the missing values. Or we can build a linear regression model that will predict missing values of Age using the features that have no missing values.

But train accuracy of a model is not enough to tell if a model can be able to generalize the unseen data or not. Because training data is something our model has been trained with, i.e., data our model has already seen it. We all know that, the purpose of building a machine learning model is to generalize the unseen data, i.e., data our model has not yet seen. Hence we can't use training accuracy for our model evaluation rather we must know how our model will perform on the data our model is yet to see.**\n\n## 11.2 Model Evaluation <a id=\"11.2\"></a>\nSo basically, to evaluate a model's performance, we need some data (input) for which we know the ground truth(label). For this problem, we don't know the ground truth for the test set but we do know for the train set. So the idea is to train and evaluate the model performance on different data. One thing we can do is to split the train set in two groups, usually in 80:20 ratio. That means we would train our model on 80% of the training data and we reserve the rest 20% for evaluating the model since we know the ground truth for this 20% data. Then we can compare our model prediction with this ground truth (for 20% data). That's how we can tell how our model would perform on unseen data. This is the first model evaluation technique. In sklearn we have a train_test_split method for that.\n\nTrain_test split has its drawbacks. Because this approach introduces bias as we are not using all of our observations for testing and also we're  reducing the train data size. To overcome this we can use a technique called cross validation where all the data is used for training and testing periodically. Thus we may reduce the bias introduced by train_test_split. From different cross validation methods, we would use k-fold cross validation. In sklearn we have a method cross_val_score for calculating k-fold cross validation score.\n\nHowever,  as the train set gets larger, train_test_split has its advantage over k-fold cross validation. Train_test_split is k-times faster than k-fold cross validation. If the training set is very large, both train_test_split and k-fold cross validation perform identically. So for a large training data, train_test_split is prefered over k-fold cross validation to accelerate the training process.\n\n### 11.2.1 K-Fold Cross Validation <a id=\"11.2.1\"></a>\nLet's say we will use 10-fold cross validation. So k = 10 and we have total 891 observations. Each fold would have 891/10 = 89.1 observations. So basically k-fold cross validation uses fold-1 (89.1 samples) as the testing set and k-1 (9 folds) as the training sets and calculates test accuracy.This procedure is repeated k times (if k = 10, then 10 times); each time, a different group of observations is treated as a validation or test set. This process results in k estimates of the test accuracy which are then averaged out."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"45eb69b73fb97937bd5a6476d57a17d10d6fcc32","scrolled":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"Create a function that returns mean cross validation score for different models.\"\"\"\ndef calculateXValScore(model):\n    \"\"\"Returns models' cross validation scores.\"\"\"\n    \n    xValScore = cross_val_score(model, xTrain, yTrain, cv = 10, scoring=\"accuracy\").mean()\n    xValScore = round(xValScore*100, 2)\n    return xValScore\n\n# Calculate cross validation scores of all the models and store them in a dataframe\nmodelScores = list(map(calculateXValScore, models))\nxValScores = pd.DataFrame(modelScores, columns = [\"xValScore\"], index=modelNames)\nxValScoresSorted = xValScores.sort_values(by=\"xValScore\", ascending=False)\nbold(\"Models 10-fold Cross Validation Score:\")\ndisplay(xValScoresSorted)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3023244ccfa300ecc5f51e9adbea756c13dd9f60"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**I've always found that trying out multiple algorithms on the same problem reveals very interesting differences in the patterns the algorithms pick up well.

That's what we will try to do using ensemble method. Ensembles combine predictions from different models to generate a final prediction, and the more models we include the better it performs. Better still, because ensembles combine baseline predictions, they perform at least as well as the best baseline model. Most of the errors from a model’s learning are from three main factors: variance, noise, and bias. By using ensemble methods, we’re able to increase the stability of the final model and reduce the errors caused by bias, variance, and noise. By combining many models, we’re able to (mostly) reduce the variance, even when they are individually not great, as we won’t suffer from random errors from a single source. **The main principle behind ensemble modelling is to group weak learners together to form one strong learner. The most basic ensemble is majority voting rule (where the prediction or vote given by the majority of the models used as final prediction).But there are many other ways to combine predictions, and more generally we can use a model to learn how to best combine predictions.**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cc503214c5c162f556d860e21af2838f5d785965"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**To implement an ensemble we need three basic things:**\n1.

In machine learning, visualizing 2 or 3 dimensional data is not that challenging. But we have 47 dimensions (47 input features). That's way too much to visualize. So we need to reduce the dimensionality- may be into 2 or 3 dimensionality. That's where PCA comes into play.**\n\n### **Introduction to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <a id=\"14.2\"></a>\nThe main goal of a PCA analysis is to identify patterns in data. PCA aims to detect the correlation between variables. If a strong correlation between variables exists, the attempt to reduce the dimensionality only makes sense. In a nutshell, this is what PCA is all about: Finding the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and project it onto a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining most of the information. PCA is very useful in the following two cases:\n1. When the training process takes too long due to large input dimension of training data.\n2. Reducing dimensions, it make data visualization a breeze.\n\nPCA is often effected if your input features have different ranges. So to make PCA work better we shoud scale the input features. We would use sklearn's StandardScaler to standarize our input features. The idea behind StandardScaler is that it will transform our data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1. **If the variables are correlated, PCA can achieve dimension reduction. If not, PCA just orders them according to their variances.**\n\n**Now let's perform standarization and then PCA to plot decision regions of different trained classifiers.**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8111992dce044af26286a2fd5299cd5d676184b3","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"Perform Standarization:\nVariables have very different ranges (diffenence between max and  min).\nThe purpose of standarization is to reduce the dispersion of these variables.\"\"\"\n\n\"\"\"Initialize standard scaler object.\"\"\"\nstdScaler = StandardScaler()\n\"\"\"Fit standard scaler object to train data.\"\"\"\nstdScaler.fit(xTrain)\n\"\"\"Apply the standard scaler to training set.\"\"\"\nxTrainScaled = stdScaler.transform(xTrain)\n\n\n\"\"\"Perform PCA:\"\"\"\n\"\"\"Initialize pca object with two components. i.e., converting into 2d from 47d.\"\"\"\npca = PCA(n_components = 2) # Projection to 2d from 47d\n\"\"\"Fit pca to scaled data.\"\"\"\npca.fit(xTrainScaled)\n\"\"\"Apply pca to scaled data.\"\"\"\npcaTrain = pca.transform(xTrainScaled)\n\"\"\"Create a data frame consisting of two pca.\"\"\"\ntrainPca = pd.DataFrame(data = pcaTrain, columns = [\"pca-1\", \"pca-2\"])\nbold(\"Projection to 2D from 47D:\")\ndisplay(trainPca.head())\n\n\"\"\"let\"s merge our two pca components with our target feature.\"\"\"\nfinalDf = pd.concat([trainPca, yTrain], axis = 1)\nbold(\"Target with 2-PCA Components:\")\ndisplay(finalDf.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"291a2bc331ce846db69c45233a74f0ebb1932db3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**So there we have it!

In an ensemble model, all classifiers (algorithms) are able to estimate class probabilities (i.e., they all have predict_proba() method), then we can specify Scikit-Learn to predict the class with the highest probability, averaged over all the individual classifiers. In a voting classifier setting the voting parameter to 'soft' enables the models to calculate their probability(also known as confidence score) individually and present it to the voting classifier, then the voting classifier averages them and outputs the class with the highest probability. If average probablity of class-1 is greater than class-0, it outputs predicted class is 1 otherwise 0. \n\n**Note:** This soft-voting classifier often work better than hard-voting as it gives more weight to highly confident votes. We Need to specify voting=”soft” and ensure that all classifiers can estimate class probabilities.

By only fitting every base learner once on a subset of the full training data, Blend ensemble is a fast ensemble that can handle very large datasets simply by only using portion of it at each stage. The cost of this approach is that information is thrown out at each stage, as one layer will not see the training data used by the previous layer. **We will use BlendEnsemble method from mlens.ensemble module to perform blending.**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"83be566944f77d7376ea56832c38fd86e9f35cec","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"Perform blending in mlens.\"\"\"\n\"\"\"Initialize blend ensembler.\"\"\"\nblend = BlendEnsemble(n_jobs = -1, test_size = 0.5, random_state = seed)\n\"\"\"Base models for blending.\"\"\"\nbaseModels = [gbc, rf, dt, knn, abc]\nblend.add(baseModels)\n\"\"\"Meta learner for blending.

To prevent this, we need to use a cross-validation strategy. Fitting an ensemble with cross-validation is often referred to as stacking, while the ensemble itself is known as the Super Learner. So basically in stacking, the individual classification models (or base models) are trained on the complete training set; then, the meta-classifier is fitted on the outputs (predictions) of those base learners. The meta-classifier can either be trained on the predicted class labels or probabilities from the ensemble.\n\n**The basic difference between blending and stacking is therefore that stacking allows both base learners and the meta learner to train on the full data set.The outcome of stacking is improved accuracy which is typical for small and medium-sized data sets, where the effect of blending can be severe. As the data set size increases, blending and stacking performs similarly and hence for large data sets blending is preferred over stacking since stacking takes significant amount of time to train the ensemble.

Hard voting, stacking and soft voting perform identical and can't beat best base rf. Since bagging performs well for high variance model, we have a feeling that we might have overfitted the training data because cross validation score for bagging is 82.61% and it still scores over 81% on kaggle leaderboard.
