As suggested by the Professor of the course, I also started to read the book 'Introduction to Statistical Learning' in parallel. This combination gave me a good insight into AI, ML and helped me quickly move towards practical coding using Python. Rather than looking for more videos and sessions, I thought to start with implementing something, so that, along the road I can step by step explore the areas as encountered. There are numerous possible paths in AI/ML. But I chose to first pick up a data set and then see what I can do with it.\n\n## Picked up a dataset\nKaggle is a very good place to find numerous datasets. I browsed some data sets and picked the Black Friday dataset.\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib as mlp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"scrolled":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"##reading the data \ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/BlackFriday.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2dcf690464af3d109760649332f29b61c075d38e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3c9a6c3209ac372731742a8fcba153d4a21a6628"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are 12 columns with different formats of data in each column."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d1ac7ba8c2ffba6b94dc639f2c575e403f526c42"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(5)\n## Looks like we have some null/NaN values in the product categories.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bf88052a7114f74fbd2b056e1c9b64c757886961"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After having a look at the data columns, I began to first think what could be the use cases of using such dataset in AI/ML.\n\t\n## I listed down the use cases I could think of..\n\t- Analyzing data for research \n\t\t○ Who is more likely to spend more in a black Friday sale?\n\t\t\t§ Men or Women.\n\t\t\t§ Married or Un Married\n\t\t\t§ Old Residents or new residents \n\t\t○ Which type of products are more likely to be sold in a sale like black Friday?\n        ○ Which type of products are common among men and which among women?\n\t- Prediction/classification-\n\t\t○ Predict Age of a customer based on the rest of available data.\n\t\t○ Predict gender of a customer based on rest of data.\n\t\t○ Predict amount of purchase based on rest of data.\n     - Recommendation -\n         ○ Suggest products based on age.\n         ○ Suggest products based on location customers belong to.\n         ○ Suggest products based on gender.\n\n***However, without exploratory data analysis and data visualization, we cannot tell if the given data will help with these use cases.
