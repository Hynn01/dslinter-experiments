Seaborn\n\nNow, let's move on to the `Seaborn` library. `seaborn` is essentially a higher-level API based on the `matplotlib` library. Among other things, it differs from the latter in that it contains more adequate default settings for plotting. By adding `import seaborn as sns; sns.set()` in your code, the images of your plots will become much nicer. Also, this library contains a set of complex tools for visualization that would otherwise (i.e. when using bare `matplotlib`) require quite a large amount of code.\n\n#### pairplot()\n\nLet's take a look at the first of such complex plots, a *pairwise relationships plot*, which creates a matrix of scatter plots by default.

The vertical line inside the box marks the median ($50\\%$) of the distribution. \n\nThe whiskers are the lines extending from the box. They represent the entire scatter of data points, specifically the points that fall within the interval $(\\text{Q1} - 1.5 \\cdot \\text{IQR}, \\text{Q3} + 1.5 \\cdot \\text{IQR})$, where $\\text{IQR} = \\text{Q3} - \\text{Q1}$ is the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range).\n\nOutliers that fall out of the range bounded by the whiskers are plotted individually.\n\n#### heatmap()\n\nThe last type of plot that we will cover here is a *heat map*.
