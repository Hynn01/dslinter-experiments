That is cool, but it is also not enough. Let's extend exponential smoothing so that we can predict two future points (of course, we will also include more smoothing).\n\nSeries decomposition will help us -- we obtain two components: intercept (i.e. level) $\\ell$ and slope (i.e. trend) $b$. We have learnt to predict intercept (or expected series value) with our previous methods; now, we will apply the same exponential smoothing to the trend by assuming that the future direction of the time series changes depends on the previous weighted changes. As a result, we get the following set of functions:\n\n$$\\ell_x = \\alpha y_x + (1-\\alpha)(\\ell_{x-1} + b_{x-1})$$\n\n$$b_x = \\beta(\\ell_x - \\ell_{x-1}) + (1-\\beta)b_{x-1}$$\n\n$$\\hat{y}_{x+1} = \\ell_x + b_x$$\n\nThe first one describes the intercept, which, as before, depends on the current value of the series. The second term is now split into previous values of the level and of the trend.

We'll look into choosing parameters automatically in a bit; before that, let's discuss triple exponential smoothing."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"191730d10bb6f117255bf7bf994490c6a18339fd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Triple exponential smoothing a.k.a. Holt-Winters\n\nWe've looked at exponential smoothing and double exponential smoothing. This time, we're going into _triple_ exponential smoothing.\n\nAs you could have guessed, the idea is to add a third component - seasonality. This means that we should not use this method if our time series is not expected to have seasonality. Seasonal components in the model will explain repeated variations around intercept and trend, and it will be specified by the length of the season, in other words by the period after which the variations repeat. For each observation in the season, there is a separate component; for example, if the length of the season is 7 days (a weekly seasonality), we will have 7 seasonal components, one for each day of the week.\n\nWith this, let's write out a new system of equations:\n\n$$\\ell_x = \\alpha(y_x - s_{x-L}) + (1-\\alpha)(\\ell_{x-1} + b_{x-1})$$\n\n$$b_x = \\beta(\\ell_x - \\ell_{x-1}) + (1-\\beta)b_{x-1}$$\n\n$$s_x = \\gamma(y_x - \\ell_x) + (1-\\gamma)s_{x-L}$$\n\n$$\\hat{y}_{x+m} = \\ell_x + mb_x + s_{x-L+1+(m-1)modL}$$\n\nThe intercept now depends on the current value of the series minus any corresponding seasonal component. Trend remains unchanged, and the seasonal component depends on the current value of the series minus the intercept and on the previous value of the component. Take into account that the component is smoothed through all the available seasons; for example, if we have a Monday component, then it will only be averaged with other Mondays. You can read more on how averaging works and how the initial approximation of the trend and seasonal components is done [here](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc435.htm). Now that we have the seasonal component, we can predict not just one or two steps ahead but an arbitrary $m$ future steps ahead, which is very encouraging.\n\nBelow is the code for a triple exponential smoothing model, which is also known by the last names of its creators, Charles Holt and his student Peter Winters. Additionally, the Brutlag method was included in the model to produce confidence intervals:\n\n$$\\hat y_{max_x}=\\ell_{xâˆ’1}+b_{xâˆ’1}+s_{xâˆ’T}+mâ‹…d_{tâˆ’T}$$\n\n$$\\hat y_{min_x}=\\ell_{xâˆ’1}+b_{xâˆ’1}+s_{xâˆ’T}-mâ‹…d_{tâˆ’T}$$\n\n$$d_t=\\gammaâˆ£y_tâˆ’\\hat y_tâˆ£+(1âˆ’\\gamma)d_{tâˆ’T},$$\n\nwhere $T$ is the length of the season, $d$ is the predicted deviation. Other parameters were taken from triple exponential smoothing.

Then, using cross-validation, we will evaluate our chosen loss function for the given model parameters, calculate the gradient, adjust the model parameters, and so on, eventually descending to the global minimum.\n\nYou may be asking how to do cross-validation for time series because time series have this temporal structure and one cannot randomly mix values in a fold while preserving this structure. With randomization, all time dependencies between observations will be lost. This is why we will have to use a more tricky approach in optimizing the model parameters. I don't know if there's an official name to this, but on [CrossValidated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/14099/using-k-fold-cross-validation-for-time-series-model-selection), where one can find all answers but the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, the proposed name for this method is \"cross-validation on a rolling basis\".\n\nThe idea is rather simple -- we train our model on a small segment of the time series from the beginning until some $t$, make predictions for the next $t+n$ steps, and calculate an error. Then, we expand our training sample to $t+n$ value, make predictions from $t+n$ until $t+2*n$, and continue moving our test segment of the time series until we hit the last available observation. As a result, we have as many folds as $n$ will fit between the initial training sample and the last observation.\n\n<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/files/f5c/7cd/b39/f5c7cdb39ccd4ba68378ca232d20d864.png\"/>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2be317d3cbe839006c9a4c1611c58757be36df5b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, knowing how to set up cross-validation, we can find the optimal parameters for the Holt-Winters model.

(The constancy of variance is called [homoscedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity))The covariance function does not depend on time; it should only depend on the distance between observations. You can see this visually on the images in the post by [Sean Abu](http://www.seanabu.com/2016/03/22/time-series-seasonal-ARIMA-model-in-python/):\n\n- The red graph below is not stationary because the mean increases over time.\n\n<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/files/20c/9d8/a63/20c9d8a633ec436f91dccd4aedcc6940.png\"/>\n\n- We were unlucky with the variance and see the varying spread of values over time\n\n<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/files/b88/eec/a67/b88eeca676d642449cab135273fd5a95.png\"/>\n\n- Finally, the covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you will notice that the spread becomes closer as time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time in the right chart.\n\n<img src=\"https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/1ee/cb2/2f61eecb20714352840748b826e38680.png\"/>\n\nSo why is stationarity so important? Because it is easy to make predictions on a stationary series since we can assume that the future statistical properties will not be different from those currently observed. Most of the time-series models, in one way or the other, try to predict those properties (mean or variance, for example). Furture predictions would be wrong if the original series were not stationary. Unfortunately, most of the time series that we see outside of textbooks are non-stationary, but we can (and should) change this.\n\nSo, in order to combat non-stationarity, we have to know our enemy, so to speak. Let's see how we can detect it. We will look at white noise and random walks to learn how to get from one to another for free."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"26180525eca40f1ba8905a597d7c0423a6a17e20"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"White noise chart:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c16e58451999c37f2ea9899bf8cf84335694e684","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"white_noise = np.random.normal(size=1000)\nwith plt.style.context('bmh'):  \n    plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))\n    plt.plot(white_noise)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c4a787e1efadbc47ec4ec10b724e824b6d8d655c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The process generated by the standard normal distribution is stationary and oscillates around 0 with with deviation of 1.

On the second plot with $\\rho$ increased to 0.6, wider cycles appeared, but it still appears stationary overall. The third plot deviates even more from the 0 mean but still oscillates about the mean. Finally, with $\\rho=1$, we have a random walk process i.e. a non-stationary time series.\n\nThis happens because, after reaching the critical value, the series $x_t = \\rho x_{t-1} + e_t$ does not return to its mean value. If we subtract $x_{t-1}$ from both sides, we will get $x_t - x_{t-1} = (\\rho - 1) x_{t-1} + e_t$, where the expression on the left is referred to as the first difference. If $\\rho=1$, then the first difference gives us stationary white noise $e_t$. This is the main idea behind the [Dickey-Fuller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) for stationarity of time series (testing the presence of a unit root). If we can get a stationary series from a non-stationary series using the first difference, we call those series integrated of order 1. The null hypothesis of the test is that the time series is non-stationary, which was rejected on the first three plots and finally accepted on the last one. We have to say that the first difference is not always enough to get a stationary series as the process might be integrated of order d, d > 1 (and have multiple unit roots). In such cases, the augmented Dickey-Fuller test is used, which checks multiple lags at once.\n\nWe can fight non-stationarity using different approaches: various order differences, trend and seasonality removal, smoothing, and transformations like Box-Cox or logarithmic."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"02e34bc226bd70a97121309e8fcb5c5b8bfcad5f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Getting rid of non-stationarity and building SARIMA"},{"metadata":{"code_folding":[],"_uuid":"1519787492610234d1969170a21bc7abd0b98ed1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's build an ARIMA model by walking through all the ~~circles of hell~~ stages of making a series stationary."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ce5b135e055754f68365631e85d70ba4634461d1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here is the code to render plots."},{"metadata":{"code_folding":[],"collapsed":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"10fb3b2a81881043deffcaed5606e291c3109002"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def tsplot(y, lags=None, figsize=(12, 7), style='bmh'):\n    \"\"\"\n        Plot time series, its ACF and PACF, calculate Dickeyâ€“Fuller test\n        \n        y - timeseries\n        lags - how many lags to include in ACF, PACF calculation\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(y, pd.Series):\n        y = pd.Series(y)\n        \n    with plt.style.context(style):    \n        fig = plt.figure(figsize=figsize)\n        layout = (2, 2)\n        ts_ax = plt.subplot2grid(layout, (0, 0), colspan=2)\n        acf_ax = plt.subplot2grid(layout, (1, 0))\n        pacf_ax = plt.subplot2grid(layout, (1, 1))\n        \n        y.plot(ax=ts_ax)\n        p_value = sm.tsa.stattools.adfuller(y)[1]\n        ts_ax.set_title('Time Series Analysis Plots\\n Dickey-Fuller: p={0:.5f}'.format(p_value))\n        smt.graphics.plot_acf(y, lags=lags, ax=acf_ax)\n        smt.graphics.plot_pacf(y, lags=lags, ax=pacf_ax)\n        plt.tight_layout()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5f5177aa0556b89a3c6ac3fdb152fc3cc0c38148","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"tsplot(ads.Ads, lags=60)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ed4d3c17e7a33be6afbe1356b767d21bdf471f72"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Surprisingly, the initial series are stationary; the Dickey-Fuller test rejected the null hypothesis that a unit root is present.

The basic assumption is that the current series values depend on its previous values with some lag (or several lags). The maximum lag in the model is referred to as $p$. To determine the initial $p$, you need to look at the PACF plot and find the biggest significant lag after which **most** other lags become insignificant.\n- $MA(q)$ - moving average model. Without going into too much detail, this models the error of the time series, again with the assumption that the current error depends on the previous with some lag, which is referred to as $q$. The initial value can be found on the ACF plot with the same logic as before. \n\nLet's combine our first 4 letters:\n\n$AR(p) + MA(q) = ARMA(p, q)$\n\nWhat we have here is the Autoregressiveâ€“moving-average model! If the series is stationary, it can be approximated with these 4 letters. Let's continue.\n\n- $I(d)$ - order of integration. This is simply the number of nonseasonal differences needed to make the series stationary. In our case, it's just 1 because we used first differences. \n\nAdding this letter to the four gives us the $ARIMA$ model which can handle non-stationary data with the help of nonseasonal differences. Great, one more letter to go!\n\n- $S(s)$ - this is responsible for seasonality and equals the season period length of the series\n\nWith this, we have three parameters: $(P, D, Q)$\n\n- $P$ - order of autoregression for the seasonal component of the model, which can be derived from PACF. But you need to look at the number of significant lags, which are the multiples of the season period length. For example, if the period equals 24 and we see the 24-th and 48-th lags are significant in the PACF, that means the initial $P$ should be 2.\n\n- $Q$ - similar logic using the ACF plot instead.\n\n- $D$ - order of seasonal integration.

If we make a 1 lag shift and train a model on that feature, the model will be able to forecast 1 step ahead from having observed the current state of the series. Increasing the lag, say, up to 6, will allow the model to make predictions 6 steps ahead; however it will use data observed 6 steps back.

Unfortunately, or maybe luckily, there is no one way to solve these kind of problems. Methods developed in the 1960s (and some even in the beginning of the 21st century) are still popular, along with LSTMs and RNNs (not covered in this article). This is partially related to the fact that the prediction task, like any other data-related task, requires creativity in so many aspects and definitely requires research. In spite of the large number of formal quality metrics and approaches to parameters estimation, it is often necessary to try something different for each time series. Last but not least, the balance between quality and cost is important. As a good example, the SARIMA model can produce spectacular results after tuning but can require many hours of ~~tambourine dancing~~ time series manipulation while a simple linear regression model can be built in 10 minutes and can achieve more or less comparable results."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"efc12abb808a134654828622418ea5a327dcfab8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Useful resources\n\n- [Online textbook](https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411home.htm) for the advanced statistical forecasting course at Duke University - covers various smoothing techniques in detail along with linear and ARIMA models\n- [Comparison of ARIMA and Random Forest time series models for prediction of avian influenza H5N1 outbreaks](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-276) - one of a few cases where using random forest for time series forecasting is actively defended\n- [Time Series Analysis (TSA) in Python - Linear Models to GARCH](http://www.blackarbs.com/blog/time-series-analysis-in-python-linear-models-to-garch/11/1/2016) - applying the ARIMA models family to the task of modeling financial indicators (by Brian Christopher)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
