In my (very long and entertaining, thankfully) quest to becoming a data scientist, I've been asked some straightforward and basic questions and still, I found it hard to give a proper answer. \n\nAccording to Glassdoor, 'Data Scientist' is the best job in America for the second year in a row while a new study by CareerCast.com revealed data scientist jobs have the best growth potential over the next seven year. Clearly, Data Science is THE hype, the real deal. Yet, it remains somewhat hard to set boundaries and axioms for Data Science, indeed, while we can say something like 'Being good at  probabilities and stochastic processes guarantees success as a QR' (sorry fellow financial engineers), there's no equivalent for Data Science, at least in my opinion.\n\nThis Kaggle survey aims to dig deeper and understand how data science is perceived through expert data scientists and aspiring data scientists using this wonderful platform. The data that we've been given will help us understand what platforms people use to learn data science, what's the most valuable skill in data science, what data scientists are looking for when they're job hunting, what programming language is most frequently used and a lot more.\n\nIn the following, not only will you get the answer to nearly any question related to Data Science, **you'll also be able to predict your salary as a data scientist given some very basic properties (see section 3.6 for the machine learning stuff) !!**\n\nLet's now embark on a journey of Data Science discovery. Enjoy the ride !"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c82f465b-c452-4cfb-b9f3-df726ab7ad2b","_uuid":"d39564daed3ef49aaf00b5582e23e354c4f32d2e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of contents\n***\n\n* [About the survey](#introduction)\n* [1.

Dig as deep as I can in this survey's results to expose interesting insights that could give anyone a better understanding about the Data Science world as it is in 2017, be it from a worker point of view or a learner's one.\n2. Expose various data analysis / visualization tools for data science beginners who read this notebook (such as plotly library, seaborn, matplotlib, Tableau and MCA technique for dimensionality reduction when dealing with categorical variables) providing references and link to tutorials when possible.\n3. Create a basic classification problem from the dataset and solve it with the most simple machine learning model : logistic regression then show the usual metrics we use in those problems : accuracy, precision, recall and auc/roc score.\n\n### As for the key takeaways of this Kernel : \n\n**On the analysis side : **\n* The gender gap in Kaggle users is huge unfortunately , at least for the moment ! Most of Kagglers are either master's or bachelor's graduates who had CS as a major and are now employed full-time.\n* For narrative reasons, my second section was named 'Python Vs R : Let the battle begin' and I painted that as an epic confrontation. The truth is, as Mr @gmobaz wisely pointed out in the comment section, there's no fight and no clear winner. It's more about understanding the synergy between both languages, how the complement each other and where each one seems to perform best. Personnaly, I'm a Python user but when I first discovered MCA, I found more performing libraries on R than on Python and that often happens for statistic tools, and that's what's beautiful about R and Python : knowing how to use both of them really makes one able to use some techniques a lot more efficiently. In fact, if you recall in the methods plot for example, we said that 'Both' users were having the best of both worlds.\n* Learners' favourite platform for learning is ... Kaggle ! They can't wait to learn more about Neural Networks and Tensorflow, they firmly believe that the future of deep learning is bright (and they're probably right :) ). They devote around 8-10 hours a week to their Data science training and when looking for work, the most important criteria for them is how much they can improve professionaly.\n\n**On the technical side : **\n* When you want to measure correlation between two categorical variables, chi2-test is a good start. For python users, scipy.stats has all statistic tests you could need.\n* When you conduct a study about income, make sure not to merge all countries together as that could lead to biased and generally false results.\n* PCA has a less known version of itself very well suited to dealing with categorical variables, it can produce really beautiful plots.\n* We don't always need very sophisticated models to get good enough results in Machine Learning, instead, we need to carefully choose the features we're going to use, the parameters for the models etc ... A logistic regression can take you a long way if you use it carefully. Well, if you see again the methods / algorithms plot per language programming, you'll notice that logistic regression is always the most used technique :)\n* Accuracy can be misleading in classification problems, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets, don't forget about precision and recall ! \n\n\nWell, it seems like everything that needs to be said has been said ! \n\nI really hope that anyone that comes across this kernel ends up learning something new either on the analysis part, the technical one or even both of them !\n\nI'm open to any suggestions and would love to get some feedback so don't hesitate to contact me or put something on the comment section.\n\nThank you for your time !\n\n## **Please upvote if you liked the kernel, that would be very encouraging :).**\n"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"file_extension":".py","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","mimetype":"text/x-python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"version":3,"name":"ipython"}},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
