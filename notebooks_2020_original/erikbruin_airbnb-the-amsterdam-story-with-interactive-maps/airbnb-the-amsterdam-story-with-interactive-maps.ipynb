Indeed, this is **my very first Python kernel**. Am I going to abandon R? Certainly not! I just want to broaden my options and knowledge, and strongly believe that I will continue to use both in the future. My initial thoughts on this are:\n\n* Use R for EDAs. Although visualizations with Python are not bad, ggplot just looks better and I find it quite easy to compose visualizations with ggplot. Also, Rmarkdown offers neat additional features that Python does not have (such as Tabs, and automatic generation of the Table of Content).\n* Use R for statistics\n* Use R for creating interactive web apps (with Shiny)\n* Use Python for machine learning and deep learning\n* Use Python for big datasets. I know that R can handle big datasets too with data.table, but I am a big fan of tidyverse. The readability of code decreases when using data.table, and I chose not to learn it. \n* Chose R or Python depending on the libraries available. CRAN (R) has many more (data science) libraries than Python. I know for instance that there are domain specific packages for Finance. If R or Python offers a specific package that really suits the task at hand, I will likely choose the language with the best libraries on offer.\n\nInsideairbnb.com is a website on which web scraped datasets of \"snapshots\" of cities are published. I have downloaded the files of Amsterdam of the situation on December 6th, 2018. I thought it is a fun dataset to take on. Besides basic data wrangling and plots, I have also added **interactive Folium maps, interactive plotly graphs, and text mining of the review comments.**\n<br>\n<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gEX4RCf.png\"></center>\n<br>\n\n\n# Table of contents\n\n* [1.

However, I used to know somebody who lived there as a student years ago. At that time it certainly was not a good neighbourhood, and I was warned to \"stay under the balconies\" as people might throw rubbish and old furniture from their balconies. Getting an old couch on your head did not sound like the most pleasant thing in the world ;-).\n\n<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7cso9GD.png\" style=\"width: 800px;\"/></center>"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"07dbd0396cdc3c932c15c0f969a167755a8ef2f7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.3 Review scores location, and location scores versus price\nIn tis section, I am grouping the review scores for the location by neighbourhood (only listings with at least 10 reviews). Although I expect the distance to the city centre to an important factor, these score should also take other things into account. Other factors may include:\n\n* The safety of a location (as displayed in the previous section)\n* Noise. If a listing is centrally located, but surrounded by noisy bars, that should cost points in the location review score.\n* If a listing is located outside the city centre but well connected by public transportation, it should get bonus points for that.\n* Facilities near the listing. Are there any supermarkets, bars and restaurants nearby?\n* Some people may be looking for free parking if they come by car (parking is very expensive in Amsterdam in general).\n\nBelow we see that the central neighbourhoods, which were generally also the most expensive, generally also score higher on location review score.  If I would calculate the distance to the city centre for each listing, I expect to see pretty strong correlations between this distance with both price and location review score.\n\nWhen looking at the average review score, I am surprised to see that the average is above 8/10 for all neighbourhoods! I know that Amsterdam is a small city (much smaller than many people might think!). Therefore, it does not take much time to get to the city centre from anywhere, which might explain the high averages to a certain extend. My personal advice to tourists would be to consider more affordable accommodation outside the city centre, in a safe neighbourhood, and with good public transportation connections to the city centre anyway. However, are the differences between the best locations and outside neighbourhoods really that small?

Guests can give ratings on:\n\n* Overall Experience. What was your overall experience?\n* Cleanliness. Did you feel that your space was clean and tidy?\n* Accuracy. How accurately did your listing page represent your space?\n* Value. Did you feel your listing provided good value for the price?\n* Communication. How well did you communicate with your host before and during their stay?\n* Arrival. How smoothly did their check-in go?\n* Location. How did you feel about the neighborhood?\n\nBelow you can see the scores distribution of all those categories. What caught my eye immediately is that scores seem really high across the board! A quick internet search told me that this seems common across Airbnb. It is explained well in this article: [Higher than the average rating? 95% of Airbnb listings rated 4.5 to 5 stars](https://mashable.com/2015/02/25/airbnb-reviews-above-average/?europe=true#1YLfzOC34sqd).\n\nAfter having seen the scores distributions, I would personally consider any score of 8 or lower to be not a good score. If I wanted to use any of these scores in a search for accomodation, I believe the \"Value\" seems most useful. First of all, I always like to get good value for money ;-). However, the number of \"10 averages\" is reasonably small, which makes the indicator a bit more \"distinguishable\" than other indicators."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"a06f6a221bfe1d02a9868a521f2ea05d4bc0e8bf","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"listings10 = listings[listings['number_of_reviews']>=10]\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,15))\nplt.rc('xtick', labelsize=16) \nplt.rc('ytick', labelsize=16)\n\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(321)\nfeq=listings10['review_scores_location'].value_counts().sort_index()\nax1=feq.plot.bar(color='b', width=1, rot=0)\n#ax1.tick_params(axis = 'both', labelsize = 16)\nplt.title(\"Location\", fontsize=24)\nplt.ylabel('Number of listings', fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel('Average review score', fontsize=14)\n\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(322)\nfeq=listings10['review_scores_cleanliness'].value_counts().sort_index()\nax2=feq.plot.bar(color='b', width=1, rot=0)\nplt.title(\"Cleanliness\", fontsize=24)\nplt.ylabel('Number of listings', fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel('Average review score', fontsize=14)\n\nax3 = fig.add_subplot(323)\nfeq=listings10['review_scores_value'].value_counts().sort_index()\nax3=feq.plot.bar(color='b', width=1, rot=0)\nplt.title(\"Value\", fontsize=24)\nplt.ylabel('Number of listings', fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel('Average review score', fontsize=14)\n\nax4 = fig.add_subplot(324)\nfeq=listings10['review_scores_communication'].value_counts().sort_index()\nax4=feq.plot.bar(color='b', width=1, rot=0)\nplt.title(\"Communication\", fontsize=24)\nplt.ylabel('Number of listings', fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel('Average review score', fontsize=14)\n\nax5 = fig.add_subplot(325)\nfeq=listings10['review_scores_checkin'].value_counts().sort_index()\nax5=feq.plot.bar(color='b', width=1, rot=0)\nplt.title(\"Arrival\", fontsize=24)\nplt.ylabel('Number of listings', fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel('Average review score', fontsize=14)\n\nax6 = fig.add_subplot(326)\nfeq=listings10['review_scores_accuracy'].value_counts().sort_index()\nax6=feq.plot.bar(color='b', width=1, rot=0)\nplt.title(\"Accuracy\", fontsize=24)\nplt.ylabel('Number of listings', fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel('Average review score', fontsize=14)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4670b85656850659a35e6a47d46228658c22f37e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.5 Finding a good host\nAt Airbnb you can get the status \"Superhost\".
