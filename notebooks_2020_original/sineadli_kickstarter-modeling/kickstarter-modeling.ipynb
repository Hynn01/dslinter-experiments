Further, it's unlikely that the name of a project correlates that strongly to success rate.\n* **pledged and backers:** Before launching the project, a creator would not know the amount pledged or the number of backers at the project deadline. I want to use this model to predict whether my project will succeed or fail based on preliminary factors.\n![](http://)* **deadline and launched:** There is possibly a correlation between the month and year the project launched with its success rate, but I'll revisit that possibility later because I haven't done any visualizations on these features yet.\n\nI'm transforming main_category into numbers because most algorithms can only handle numbers. This will be further elaborated on later under the section \"main_category\" but by \"transformation\", I'm really saying that the values of main_category, which are strings, will be re-labeled as numbers.\n\nI'm turning both goal and campaign_days into a set of bins... that means that what was once a goal of, say, 7,800 would go into a bin labeled 2, which contains the values from 5,001 to 10,000. Using this method will take care of the fact that numbers with trailing zeroes are more likely to be chosen as the goal by the creator. In other words, although goals of 4,999 and 5,000 are *very* close to one another, the algorithm might run into some trouble because there are many more projects with goals of 5,000 than there are projects with goals of 4,999, and this discrepency may interfere with machine learning training."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"kick = kick[[\"ID\", \"main_category\", \"goal\", \"campaign_days\", \"state\"]]\nkick.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# state\nChange the state into either 0 for failed or 1 for successful."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"kick.loc[kick[\"state\"] == \"successful\", \"state\"] = 1\nkick.loc[kick[\"state\"] == \"failed\", \"state\"] = 0\nkick[\"state\"] = kick[\"state\"].astype(\"int\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# main_category\nTransform each main category into a number.
