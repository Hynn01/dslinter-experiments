# ## About Dataset

# #### **Overview**
# 
# Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.
# 
# #### **Data Fields**
# 
# * datetime - hourly date + timestamp  
# * season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter 
# * holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday

# #### **Lets Read In The Dataset**

# In[ ]:


dailyData = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv")


# ## Data Summary
# 
# As a first step lets do three simple steps on the dataset
# 
#  - Size of the dataset
#  - Get a glimpse of data by printing few rows of it.
#  - What type of variables contribute our data

# #### **Shape Of The Dataset**

# In[ ]:


dailyData.shape


# #### **Sample Of First Few Rows**

# In[ ]:


dailyData.head(2)


# #### **Variables Data Type**

# In[ ]:


dailyData.dtypes


# ## Feature Engineering

# As we see from the above results, the columns "season","holiday","workingday" and "weather" should be of "categorical" data type.But the current data type is "int" for those columns. Let us transform the dataset in the following ways so that we can get started up with our EDA
# 
#  - Create new columns "date,"hour","weekDay","month" from "datetime"
#    column.
#  - Coerce the datatype of "season","holiday","workingday" and weather to category.
#  - Drop the datetime column as we already extracted useful features from it.

# #### **Creating New Columns From "Datetime" Column**

# In[ ]:


dailyData["date"] = dailyData.datetime.apply(lambda x : x.split()[0])
dailyData["hour"] = dailyData.datetime.apply(lambda x : x.split()[1].split(":")[0])
dailyData["weekday"] = dailyData.date.apply(lambda dateString : calendar.day_name[datetime.strptime(dateString,"%Y-%m-%d").weekday()])
dailyData["month"] = dailyData.date.apply(lambda dateString : calendar.month_name[datetime.strptime(dateString,"%Y-%m-%d").month])
dailyData["season"] = dailyData.season.map({1: "Spring", 2 : "Summer", 3 : "Fall", 4 :"Winter" })
dailyData["weather"] = dailyData.weather.map({1: " Clear + Few clouds + Partly cloudy + Partly cloudy",                                        2 : " Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist ",                                         3 : " Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds",                                         4 :" Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog " })


# #### **Coercing To Category Type**

# In[ ]:


categoryVariableList = ["hour","weekday","month","season","weather","holiday","workingday"]
for var in categoryVariableList:
    dailyData[var] = dailyData[var].astype("category")


# #### **Dropping Unncessary Columns**

# In[ ]:


dailyData  = dailyData.drop(["datetime"],axis=1)


# #### **Lets Start With Very Simple Visualization Of Variables DataType Count**

# In[ ]:


dataTypeDf = pd.DataFrame(dailyData.dtypes.value_counts()).reset_index().rename(columns={"index":"variableType",0:"count"})
fig,ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(12,5)
sn.barplot(data=dataTypeDf,x="variableType",y="count",ax=ax)
ax.set(xlabel='variableTypeariable Type', ylabel='Count',title="Variables DataType Count")


# ## Missing Values Analysis

# Once we get hang of the data and columns, next step we geneally is to find out whether we have any missing values in our data. Luckily we dont have any missing value in the dataset. One way which I generally prefer to visualize missing value in the dataset is through "missingno".
# 
# Its a quiet handy library to quickly visualize variables for missing values. As I mentioned earlier we got lucky this time as there no missing value in the dataset.

# ## Skewness In Distribution ##

# In[ ]:


msno.matrix(dailyData,figsize=(12,5))


# ## Outliers Analysis
# 
# At first look, "count" variable contains lot of outlier data points which skews the distribution towards right (as there are more data points beyond Outer Quartile Limit).But in addition to that, following inferences can also been made from the simple boxplots given below.
# 
#  - Spring season has got relatively lower count.The dip in median value
#    in boxplot gives evidence for it.
#  - The boxplot with "Hour Of The Day" is quiet interesting.The median value are relatively higher at 7AM - 8AM and 5PM - 6PM. It can be attributed to regular school and office users at that time. 
#  - Most of the outlier points are mainly contributed from "Working Day" than "Non Working Day". It is quiet visible from from figure 4.

# In[ ]:


fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2,ncols=2)
fig.set_size_inches(12, 10)
sn.boxplot(data=dailyData,y="count",orient="v",ax=axes[0][0])
sn.boxplot(data=dailyData,y="count",x="season",orient="v",ax=axes[0][1])
sn.boxplot(data=dailyData,y="count",x="hour",orient="v",ax=axes[1][0])
sn.boxplot(data=dailyData,y="count",x="workingday",orient="v",ax=axes[1][1])

axes[0][0].set(ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count")
axes[0][1].set(xlabel='Season', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Season")
axes[1][0].set(xlabel='Hour Of The Day', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Hour Of The Day")
axes[1][1].set(xlabel='Working Day', ylabel='Count',title="Box Plot On Count Across Working Day")


# #### **Lets Remove Outliers In The Count Column**

# In[ ]:


dailyDataWithoutOutliers = dailyData[np.abs(dailyData["count"]-dailyData["count"].mean())<=(3*dailyData["count"].std())] 


# In[ ]:


print ("Shape Of The Before Ouliers: ",dailyData.shape)
print ("Shape Of The After Ouliers: ",dailyDataWithoutOutliers.shape)


# ## Correlation Analysis
# 
# One common to understand how a dependent variable is influenced by features (numerical) is to fibd a correlation matrix between them. Lets plot a correlation plot between "count" and ["temp","atemp","humidity","windspeed"].
# 
#  - temp and humidity features has got positive and negative correlation
#    with count respectively.Although the correlation between them are not
#    very prominent still the count variable has got little dependency on
#    "temp" and "humidity".
#  - windspeed is not gonna be really useful numerical feature and it is visible from it correlation value with "count"
#  - "atemp" is variable is not taken into since "atemp" and "temp" has got strong correlation with each other. During model building any one of the variable has to be dropped since they will exhibit multicollinearity in the data.
#  - "Casual" and "Registered" are also not taken into account since they are leakage variables in nature and need to dropped during model building.
# 
# Regression plot in seaborn is one useful way to depict the relationship between two features. Here we consider "count" vs "temp", "humidity", "windspeed".

# In[ ]:


corrMatt = dailyData[["temp","atemp","casual","registered","humidity","windspeed","count"]].corr()
mask = np.array(corrMatt)
mask[np.tril_indices_from(mask)] = False
fig,ax= plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(20,10)
sn.heatmap(corrMatt, mask=mask,vmax=.8, square=True,annot=True)


# In[ ]:


fig,(ax1,ax2,ax3) = plt.subplots(ncols=3)
fig.set_size_inches(12, 5)
sn.regplot(x="temp", y="count", data=dailyData,ax=ax1)
sn.regplot(x="windspeed", y="count", data=dailyData,ax=ax2)
sn.regplot(x="humidity", y="count", data=dailyData,ax=ax3)


# ## Visualizing Distribution Of Data
# As it is visible from the below figures that "count" variable is skewed towards right. It is desirable to have Normal distribution as most of the machine learning techniques require dependent variable to be Normal. One possible solution is to take log transformation on "count" variable after removing outlier data points. After the transformation the data looks lot better but still not ideally following normal distribution.

# In[ ]:


fig,axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2,nrows=2)
fig.set_size_inches(12, 10)
sn.distplot(dailyData["count"],ax=axes[0][0])
stats.probplot(dailyData["count"], dist='norm', fit=True, plot=axes[0][1])
sn.distplot(np.log(dailyDataWithoutOutliers["count"]),ax=axes[1][0])
stats.probplot(np.log1p(dailyDataWithoutOutliers["count"]), dist='norm', fit=True, plot=axes[1][1])


# ## Visualizing Count Vs (Month,Season,Hour,Weekday,Usertype)
# 
#  - It is quiet obvious that people tend to rent bike during summer
#    season since it is really conducive to ride bike at that
#    season.Therefore June, July and August has got relatively higher
#    demand for bicycle.
#  - On weekdays more people tend to rent bicycle around 7AM-8AM and 5PM-6PM. As we mentioned earlier this can be attributed to regular school and office commuters.
#  - Above pattern is not observed on "Saturday" and "Sunday".More people tend to rent bicycle between 10AM and 4PM.
#  - The peak user count around 7AM-8AM and 5PM-6PM is purely contributed by registered user.
