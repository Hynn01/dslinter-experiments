# # <span id="1"></span> Overview
# <hr/>
# Welcome to my Kernel! In this kernel, I use various regression methods and try to predict the house prices by using them. As you can guess, there are various methods to suceed this and each method has pros and cons. I think **regression is one of the most important methods because it gives us more insight about the data**. When we ask **why**, it is easier to interpret the relation between the response and explanatory variables. 
# 
# I start with a very simple model and continue with more complex ones after visualizing some features and a data mining process. I try to find the best regression for this dataset. 
# 
# On the other hand, if you are looking for more theory and do not want to use built in functions, I recommend you to check my other kernel [k-NN, Logistic Regression, k-Fold CV from Scratch](https://www.kaggle.com/burhanykiyakoglu/k-nn-logistic-regression-k-fold-cv-from-scratch).

# #### [Return Contents](#0)
# <hr/>

# In order to make some analysis, we need to set our environment up. To do this, I firstly imported some modules and read data. The below output is the head of the data but if you want to see more details, you might try removing ***#*** signs in front of the ***df.describe()*** and ***df.info()***.  
# 
# Further, I defined an empty dataframe. This dataframe includes **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, Adjusted R-squared** and **mean of the R-squared values obtained by the k-Fold Cross Validation**, which are the important metrics to compare different models. Having a **R-squared value closer to one** and **smaller RMSE** means a better fit. In the following sections, I will fill this dataframe with my results.

# #### [Return Contents](#0)
# <hr/>

# The R-squared increases when the number of features increase. Because of this, sometimes a more robust evaluator is preferred to compare the performance between different models. This evaluater is called adjusted R-squared and it only increases, if the addition of the variable reduces the MSE. The definition of the adjusted $R^{2}$ is:
# 
# $\bar{R^{2}}=R^{2}-\frac{k-1}{n-k}(1-R^{2})$
# 
# where $n$ is the number of observations and $k$ is the number of parameters.

# # <span id="4"></span> Creating a Simple Linear Regression
# #### [Return Contents](#0)
# <hr/>

# When we model a linear relationship between a response and **just one** explanatory variable, this is called **simple linear regression**. I want to predict house prices and then, our response variable is price. However, for a simple model we also need to select a feature. When I look at the columns of the dataset, living area (sqft) seemed the most important feature. When we examine the  <a href=#7>correlation matrix</a>, we may observe that price has the highest correlation coefficient with living area (sqft) and this also supports my opinion. Thus, I decided to use **living area (sqft)** as feature but if you want to examine the relationship between price and another feature, you may prefer that feature.

# This is not a very big data and we do not have too many features. Thus, we have chance to plot most of them and reach some useful analytical results. Drawing charts and examining the data before applying a model is a very good practice because we may detect some possible outliers or decide to do normalization. This is not a must but get know the data is always good. Then, I started with the histograms of dataframe.

# To determine bedrooms, floors or bathrooms/bedrooms vs price, I preferred **boxplot** because we have numerical data but they are not continuous as 1,2,... bedrooms, 2.5, 3,... floors (probably 0.5 stands for the penthouse). 
# 
# From the below charts, it can be seen that there are very few houses which have some features or price appears far from others like 33 bedrooms or price around 7000000. However, determining their possible negative effect will be time consuming and in the real data sets there will always be some outliers like some luxury house prices in this dataset. That's why I am not planning to remove outliers.

# ## <span id="7"></span> Checking Out the Correlation Among Explanatory Variables

# Having too many features in a model is not always a good thing because it might cause overfitting and worser results when we want to predict values for a new dataset. Thus, **if a feature does not improve your model a lot, not adding it may be a better choice**.
# 
# Another important thing is correlation. **If there is very high correlation between two features, keeping both of them is not a good idea most of the time not to cause overfitting**. For instance, if there is overfitting, we may remove sqt_above or sqt_living because they are highly correlated. This relation can be estimated when we look at the definitions in the dataset but to be sure correlation matrix should be checked. However, this does not mean that you must remove one of the highly correlated features. For example: bathrooms and sqrt_living. They are highly correlated but I do not think that the relation among them is the same as the relation between sqt_living and sqt_above.

# A preprocessing on data might improve the model accuracy and make the model more reliable. It does not always have to improve our results but when we are conscious of the features and use a proper input, we might reach some outcomes easier.

# ## <span id="9"></span> Binning

# Data binning is a preprocessing technique used to reduce the effects of minor observation errors. I think it is worthwhile applying to some columns of this dataset.

Also, I partitioned these columns to intervals and you can observe this in the below **histograms**.

# # <span id="15"></span> Regularization
# #### [Return Contents](#0)
# <hr/>

# **Regularization** is designed to address the problem of overfitting and undefitting. **Overfitting** means high variance and is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data. This function fits training data well but might cause poor results for the test set. On the other hand, **underfitting** means low variance and a very simple model. This might also cause poor results too. **Possible remedies** are adjusting features manually or using some model selection algoritms which brings an extra workload. Conversely, when we apply regularization, all the features are kept and the model adjusts $\theta_{j}$. This especially works when we have a lot of slightly useful features. There are two widely used regularization types (Ridge and Lasso Regressions) and in this section, I used them.
# 
# **When to use ridge vs lasso regression:**
# *  Many small/medium sized effects: use *ridge*.
# *  Only a few variables with medium/large effect: use *lasso*.
# 

# ## <span id="16"></span> Ridge Regression

# Ridge regression is called **L2 regularization** and by adding a penalty, we obtain the below equation
# 
# $$RSS_{RIDGE} = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_{\theta}(x_{i})-y_{i})^{2} + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{n}\theta^{2}_{j}$$
# 
# By changing the $\alpha$ value, we can control the amount of the regularization. When we increase $\alpha$, regularization increases and the opposite is valid too. As a result of this, I selected different $\alpha$ values and used a linear regression without regularization in order to observe the differences easily.

# # <span id="18"></span> Polynomial Regression
# #### [Return Contents](#0)
# <hr/>

# For the linear models, the main idea is to fit a straight line to our data. However, if the data has a quadratic distribution, this time choosing a quadratic function and applying a polynomial transformation may give us better results. This time the hypothesis function is defined as
# 
# $$h_{\theta}(X)=\theta_{0}+\theta_{1}x+\theta_{2}x^{2}+...+\theta_{n}x^{n}$$
# 
# Since there are many variations for the polynomial regression, I prefered to show results by a new table and it can be seen from the below table that polynomial transformation improved the model fit a lot. On the other hand, while using polynomial transformation and deciding to degree, we should be very careful because it **migh cause overfitting**. Also, in the below table overfitting exists for some models. The 5-fold cross validation metrics are negative or low for these models although they have very high R-squared values for the training set.

# # <span id="19"></span> k-NN Regression

# <hr/>

# I included k-NN regression in this kernel but actually, I did not expect to obtain a good result by using it. Also, k-NN does not give much insight. It is a very simple method and the idea behind the algorithm is similar to the k-NN classification. Briefly, it uses the weighted average, median or another statistic you want of k-nearest instances.
# 
# The evaluation metrics for the training, test sets and different *k* values were given in the below table. It can be seen that, k-NN was not very successful as expected.

# When we look at the evaluation table, **2nd degree polynomial (all features, no preprocessing)** is the best. However, I have doubts about its reliability. I would prefer the **polynomial ridge regression (alpha=50000, degree=2, all features)** but other models might be useful depending to the situation too. 
# 
# In this kernel, I used scikit-learn which provides me all built in functions I need but if you want to examine the **theory** behind the **logistic regression**, which is used for classification and similar to the linear regression, and some other methods, you might also want to check my other kernel [k-NN, Logistic Regression, k-Fold CV from Scratch](https://www.kaggle.com/burhanykiyakoglu/k-nn-logistic-regression-k-fold-cv-from-scratch).
