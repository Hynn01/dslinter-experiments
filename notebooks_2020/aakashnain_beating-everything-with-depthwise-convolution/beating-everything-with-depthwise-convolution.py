# Hello everyone!! Hope everything is fine and you are enjoying things on Kaggle as usual. The rage for competing on Kaggle should never end. 
# Machine Learning and Deep Learning have a huge scope in healthcare but applying them in healthcare isn't that simple. The stake is very high. It's more than just a `classification` problem. But if applied very carefully, it can benefit the world in enormous ways. **And as a Machine learning engineer, it's our responsibility to help people as much as we can in all possible ways.**
# 
# Pneumonia is a very common disease. It can be either: 1) Bacterial pneumonia  2) Viral Pneumonia  3) Mycoplasma pneumonia   and 4) Fungal pneumonia.
# This dataset consists pneumonia samples belonging to the first two classes.  The dataset consists of only very few samples and that too unbalanced. The aim of this kernel is to develop a robust deep learning model from scratch on this limited amount of data. We all know that deep learning models are data hungry but if you know how things work, you can build good models even with a limited amount of data.

# Path to test directory

# We will first go through the training dataset. We will do some analysis on that, look at some of the samples, check the number of samples for each class, etc.  Lets' do it.
# 
# Each of the above directory contains two sub-directories:
# * `NORMAL`: These are the samples that describe the normal (no pneumonia) case.
# * `PNEUMONIA`: This directory contains those samples that are the pneumonia cases.

# In[4]:


# Get the path to the normal and pneumonia sub-directories
normal_cases_dir = train_dir / 'NORMAL'
pneumonia_cases_dir = train_dir / 'PNEUMONIA'

# Get the list of all the images
normal_cases = normal_cases_dir.glob('*.jpeg')

# An empty list. We will insert the data into this list in (img_path, label) format

# Shuffle the data

# If you look carefully, then there are some cases where you won't be able to differentiate between a normal case and a pneumonia case with the naked eye.

# We will normalize the pixel values and resizing all the images to 224x224 

# Normal cases
for img in normal_cases:

    if img.shape[2] ==1:

    valid_labels.append(label)

valid_data = np.array(valid_data)
valid_labels = np.array(valid_labels)

print("Total number of validation examples: ", valid_data.shape)
print("Total number of labels:", valid_labels.shape)


# ## Augmentation
# Data augmentation is a powerful technique which helps in almost every case for improving the robustness of a model. But augmentation can be much more helpful where the dataset is imbalanced. You can generate different samples of undersampled class in order to try to balance the overall distribution. 
# 
# I like [imgaug](https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) a lot. It comes with a very clean api and you can do hell of augmentations with it. It's worth exploring!!
# In the next code block, I will define a augmentation sequence. You will notice `Oneof` and it does exactly that. At each iteration, it will take one augmentation technique out of the three and will apply that on the samples 

# In[8]:


# Augmentation sequence 
seq = iaa.OneOf([
    iaa.Fliplr(), # horizontal flips
    iaa.Affine(rotate=20), # roatation
    iaa.Multiply((1.2, 1.5))]) #random brightness


# ### Training data generator 
# Here I will define a very simple data generator. You can do more than this if you want but I think at this point, this is more than enough I need.

# ## Model 
# 
# This is the best part. If you look at other kernels on this dataset, everyone is busy doing transfer learning and fine-tuning. **You should transfer learn but wisely**.  We will be doing partial transfer learning and rest of the model will be trained from scratch. I will explain this in detail but before that, I would love to share one of the best practices when it comes to building deep learning models from scratch on limited data.
# 
# 1. Choose a simple architecture.
# 2. Initialize the first few layers from a network that is pretrained on imagenet. This is because first few layers capture general details like color blobs, patches, edges, etc. Instead of randomly initialized weights for these layers, it would be much better if you fine tune them.
# 3. Choose layers that introduce a lesser number of parameters. For example, `Depthwise SeparableConv` is a good replacement for `Conv` layer. It introduces lesser number of parameters as compared to normal convolution and as different filters are applied to each channel, it captures more information.  `Xception` a powerful network, is built on top of such layers only. You can read about `Xception` and `Depthwise Separable Convolutions` in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02357) paper.
# 4. Use batch norm with convolutions.  As the network becomes deeper, batch norm start to play an important role.
# 5. Add dense layers with reasonable amount of neurons. Train with a higher learning rate and experiment with the number of neurons in the dense layers. Do it for the depth of your network too. 
# 6. Once you know a good depth, start training your network with a lower learning rate along with decay.  
# 
# This is all that I have done in the next code block.

The classifier might label every example as negative and still achieve 95% accuracy. Hence,  we need to look for alternative metrics. **Precision** and **Recall** are really good metrics for such kind of problems.

# Nice!!! So, our model has a 98% recall. In such problems, a good recall value is expected. But if you notice, the precision is only 80%. This is one thing to notice. Precision and Recall follows a trade-off, and you need to find a point where your recall, as well as your precision, is more than good but both can't increase simultaneously.
