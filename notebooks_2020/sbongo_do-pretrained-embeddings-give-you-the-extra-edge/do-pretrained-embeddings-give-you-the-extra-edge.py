# In this kernel, we shall see if pretrained embeddings like Word2Vec, GLOVE and Fasttext, which are pretrained using billions of words could improve our accuracy score as compared to training our own embedding. We will compare the performance of models using these pretrained embeddings against the baseline model that doesn't use any pretrained embeddings in my previous kernel [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sbongo/for-beginners-tackling-toxic-using-keras).

# 
# Perhaps it's a good idea to briefly step in the world of word embeddings and see what's the difference between Word2Vec, GLOVE and Fasttext.
# 
# Embeddings generally represent geometrical encodings of words based on how frequently appear together in a text corpus. Various implementations of word embeddings described below differs in the way as how they are constructed.
# 
# **Word2Vec**
# 
# The main idea behind it is that you train a model on the context on each word, so similar words will have similar numerical representations.
# 
# Just like a normal feed-forward densely connected neural network(NN) where you have a set of independent variables and a target dependent variable that you are trying to predict, you first break your sentence into words(tokenize) and create a number of pairs of words, depending on the window size. So one of the combination could be a pair of words such as ('cat','purr'), where cat is the independent variable(X) and 'purr' is the target dependent variable(Y) we are aiming to predict.
# 
# We feed the 'cat' into the NN through an embedding layer initialized with random weights, and pass it through the softmax layer with ultimate aim of predicting 'purr'. The optimization method such as SGD minimize the loss function "(target word | context words)" which seeks to minimize the loss of predicting the target words given the context words. If we do this with enough epochs, the weights in the embedding layer would eventually represent the vocabulary of word vectors, which is the "coordinates" of the words in this geometric vector space.
# 
# ![](https://i.imgur.com/R8VLFs2.png)
# 
# The above example assumes the skip-gram model. For the Continuous bag of words(CBOW), we would basically be predicting a word given the context. 
# 
# **GLOVE**
# 
# GLOVE works similarly as Word2Vec. While you can see above that Word2Vec is a "predictive" model that predicts context given word, GLOVE learns by constructing a co-occurrence matrix (words X context) that basically count how frequently a word appears in a context. Since it's going to be a gigantic matrix, we factorize this matrix to achieve a lower-dimension representation. There's a lot of details that goes in GLOVE but that's the rough idea.
# 
# **FastText**
# 
# FastText is quite different from the above 2 embeddings. While Word2Vec and GLOVE treats each word as the smallest unit to train on, FastText uses n-gram characters as the smallest unit. For example, the word vector ,"apple", could be broken down into separate word vectors units as "ap","app","ple". The biggest benefit of using FastText is that it generate better word embeddings for rare words, or even words not seen during training because the n-gram character vectors are shared with other words. This is something that Word2Vec and GLOVE cannot achieve.

Hence, we might be able to capture the essence and use it to produce a good accurate score.

# In[ ]:


embedding_matrix = loadEmbeddingMatrix('word2vec')


# In[ ]:


embedding_matrix.shape


# With the embedding weights, we can proceed to build a LSTM layer. The whole architecture is pretty much the same as the previous one I have done in the earlier kernel here, except that I have turned the LSTM into a bidirectional one, and added a dropout factor to it. 
# 
# We start off with defining our input layer. By indicating an empty space after comma, we are telling Keras to infer the number automatically.

# In[ ]:


inp = Input(shape=(maxlen, )) #maxlen=200 as defined earlier


# Next, we pass it to our Embedding layer, where we use the "weights" parameter to indicate the use of the pretrained embedding weights we have loaded and the "trainable" parameter to tell Keras **not to retrain** the embedding layer.

# In[ ]:


x = Embedding(len(tokenizer.word_index), embedding_matrix.shape[1],weights=[embedding_matrix],trainable=False)(inp)


# Next, we pass it to a LSTM unit. But this time round, we will be using a Bidirectional LSTM instead because there are several kernels which shows a decent gain in accuracy by using Bidirectional LSTM.
# 
# How does Bidirectional LSTM work? 
# 
# ![](https://i.imgur.com/jaKiP0S.png)
# 
# Imagine that the LSTM is split between 2 hidden states for each time step. As the sequence of words is being feed into the LSTM in a forward fashion, there's another reverse sequence that is feeding to the different hidden state at the same time. You might noticed later at the model summary that the output dimension of LSTM layer has doubled to 120 because 60 dimensions are used for forward, and another 60 are used for reverse.
# 
# The greatest advantage in using Bidirectional LSTM is that when it runs backwards you preserve information from the future and using the two hidden states combined, you are able in any point in time to preserve information from both past and future.
# 

# We are also introducing 2 more new mechanisms in this notebook: **LSTM Drop out and recurrent drop out.**
# 
# Why are we using dropout? You might have noticed that it's easy for LSTM to overfit, and in my previous notebook, overfitting problem starts to surface in just 2 epochs! Drop out is not something new to most of us, and these mechanisms applies the same dropout principles in a LSTM context.
# 
# ![](https://i.imgur.com/ksSyArD.png)
# LSTM Dropout is a probabilistic drop out layer on the inputs in each time step, as depict on the left diagram(arrows pointing upwards). On the other hand, recurrent drop out is something like a dropout mask that applies drop out between the hidden states throughout the recursion of the whole LSTM network, which is depicted on the right diagram(arrows pointing to the right). 
# 
# These mechanisms could be set via the "dropout" and "recurrent_dropout" parameters respectively. Please ignore the colors in the picture.
# 

# In[ ]:


x = Bidirectional(LSTM(60, return_sequences=True,name='lstm_layer',dropout=0.1,recurrent_dropout=0.1))(x)


# Okay! With the LSTM behind us, we'll feed the output into the rest of the layers which we have done so in the previous kernel. 

# In[ ]:


x = GlobalMaxPool1D()(x)


# In[ ]:


x = Dropout(0.1)(x)


# In[ ]:


x = Dense(50, activation="relu")(x)


# In[ ]:


x = Dropout(0.1)(x)

x = Dense(6, activation="sigmoid")(x)

model = Model(inputs=inp, outputs=x)
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  optimizer='adam',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])


# It's a good idea to see the whole architecture of the network before training as you wouldn't want to waste your precious time training on the wrong set-up.

# In[ ]:


model.summary()


# Finally, we fire off the training process by aiming to run for 4 epochs with a batch size of 32. We save the training and validation loss in a variable so we can take a look and see if there's overfitting.

# In[ ]:


#batch_size = 32
#epochs = 4
#hist = model.fit(X_t,y, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, validation_split=0.1)

On the other hand, Word2Vec and FastText starts to overfit at the 4rd and 3rd epochs respectively. So which one would you pick as the winner? In my opinion, **still the baseline model.**
# 
# So what went wrong? Aren't pretrained embeddings supposed to improve because it's trained with billions of words from tons of feature-rich corpus?
# 
# One probability is that these pretrained embeddings are not trained against text in the same context so the number of common words between our text and text that these pretrained embeddings were trained would be low. Let's plot the number of words we are using in the embedding layer.

# From the above bar chart, it's obvious that the baseline would have the most words since the embedding layer is trained using the words in the dataset. The important takeaway is that the pretrained embeddings only contains about 60,000 words in common(less than half of baseline) and the embedding layer that is built from these pretrained weights couldn't represent the training data well enough.

# 1. There are many pretrained embeddings in Kaggle, and they are trained in different contexts of text corpus. You could try out other pretrained embeddings that is more suitable to the dataset in our competition.
# 2. Introduce LSTM drop out and recurrent drop out in baseline model, and tune the dropout rate to decrease overfitting.
