# ## Did you find an interesting article and want to easily find related research without browsing all existing publications yourself? Do you have a specific research question and want to discover relevant articles? Then this notebook might help you.
# 
# **Approach**:
# We first discover a number of topics using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). This allows us to view each article as a mixture of these topics. By mapping a specific article into the topic space (a simplex with a topic in each corner), we can then find related articles.
#

# ### Website now available on [discovid.ai](https://discovid.ai)!
# Because of all the positive feedback and the growing interest in this recommendation system, we are now hosting it as a web service to make it more accessible to the broader public!
# 
# Check out the following notebook for more information: https://www.kaggle.com/danielwolffram/discovid-ai-a-search-and-recommendation-engine.
# We now use a **whoosh search engine** as an initial search that allows complex boolean queries or to search specific fields (title, abstract, authors, journal, doi, methods). This topic model is then used to find related articles.

# ___
# 
# ** Features**
# * Similarity measure to show the **confidence** in the recommendations
# * Plots that show the **topic-distribution** of an article
# * Select a **time range** to limit the articles that are considered (you can decide if you want to find the latest publications or search for insights in past research)
# * Option to only suggest **COVID-19-papers** (those that contain COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov, SARS Coronavirus 2 or 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the text body)
# 
# 
# **Pros**:
# * Doesn't only use the title or meta-data, but the actual content (text body) of the articles 
# * Once trained, the model is easy and fast to apply
# * Helps to discover latent relationships between articles that might drive innovation
# 
# **Cons**:
# * Unsupervised learning of topics is hard to verify
