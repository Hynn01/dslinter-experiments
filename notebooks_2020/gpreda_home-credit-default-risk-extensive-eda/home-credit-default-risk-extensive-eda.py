# # <a id="1">Introduction</a>

# <a href="http://www.homecredit.net/">Home Credit</a> is a non-banking financial institution, founded in 1997 in the Czech Republic.
# 
# The company operates in 14 countries (including United States, Russia, Kazahstan, Belarus, China, India) and focuses on lending primarily to people with little or no credit history which will either not obtain loans or became victims of untrustworthly lenders.
# 
# Home Credit group has over 29 million customers, total assests of 21 billions Euro, over 160 millions loans, with the majority in Asia and and almost half of them in China (as of 19-05-2018). 
# 
# The company uses of a variety of alternative data - including telco and transactional information - to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
# 
# They made available their data to the Kaggle community and are challenging Kagglers to help them unlock the full potential of their data.

# 
# The dataframe *application_train* and *application_test* contains the loan and loan applicants. The dataframe *bureau* contains the application data from other loans that the client took from other credit institutions and were reported to the credit bureau. The dataframe *previous_applications* contains information about previous loans at **Home Credit** by the same client, previous loans information and client information at the time of the loan (there is a line in the dataframe per previous loan application).
# 
# **SK_ID_CURR** is connecting the dataframes *application_train*|*test* with *bureau*, *previous_application* and also with dataframes *POS_CASH_balance*, *installments_payment* and *credit_card_balance*. **SK_ID_PREV** connects dataframe *previous_application* with *POS_CASH_balance*, *installments_payment* and *credit_card_balance*. **SK_ID_BUREAU** connects dataframe *bureau* with dataframe *bureau_balance*.

#

# In[ ]:


plot_b_stats('CREDIT_ACTIVE')


# Most of the credits registered at the Credit Bureau are in the status *Closed* (~900K). On the second place are the *Active* credits ( a bit under 600K). *Sold* and *Bad debt* are just a few.
# 
# In the same time, as percent having **TARGET = 1** from total number per category, clients with credits registered to the Credit Bureau with *Bad debt* have 20%  default on the currrent applications. 
# 
# 
# Clients with credits *Sold*, *Active* and *Closed* have percent of **TARGET == 1** (default credit) equal or less than 10% (10% being the rate overall). The smallest rate of default credit have the clients with credits registered at the Credit Bureau with *Closed* credits.
# 
# That means the former registered credit history (as registered at Credit Bureau) is a strong predictor for the dafault credit, since the percent of applications defaulting with a history of *Bad debt* is twice as large as for *Sold* or *Active* and almost three times larger as for *Closed*.

# ### Credit currency
# 
# Let's check now the number of credits registered at the Credit Bureau with different currencies. Also, let's check procent of defaulting credits (for current applications) per different currencies of credits credits registered at the Credit Bureau in the past for the same client.

# In[ ]:


plot_b_stats('CREDIT_CURRENCY')


# Credits are mostly in *currency_1*.
# 
# Depending on the currency, the percent of clients defaulting is quite different. Starting with *currency_3*, then *currency_1* and *currency_2*, the percent of clients defaulting is 11%, 8% and 5%. Percent of defaulting applications for clients that have credits registered with *currency_4* is close to 0.

# ### Credit type
# 
# Let's check now the credit types for credits registered at the Credit Bureau.

# In[ ]:


plot_b_stats('CREDIT_TYPE', True, True)


# Majority of historical credits registered at the Credit Bureau are *Consumer credit* and *Credit card*. Smaller number of credits are *Car loan*, *Mortgage* and *Microloan*.
# 
# Looking now to the types of historical credits registered at the Credit Bureau, there are few types with a high percent of current credit defaults, as following:  
# * *Loan for the purchase of equipment* - with over 20% current credits defaults;  
# * *Microloan* - with over 20% current credits defaults;  
# * *Loan for working capital replenishement* - with over 12% current credits defaults.

plot_p_stats('NAME_CONTRACT_TYPE_y')


# There are three types of contract in the previous application data: *Cash loans*, *Consumer loans*, *Revolving loans*. *Cash loans* and *Consumer loans* are almost the same number (~600K) whilst *Revolving loans* are ~150K.
# 
# The percent of defauls loans for clients with previous applications is different for the type of previous applications contracts, decreasing from ~10% for *Revolving loans*, then ~ 9.5% for *Cash loans* and ~8% for *Consumer loans*.

# ### Cash loan purpose
# 
# Let's look to the cash loan purpose, in the case of cash loans.

# In[ ]:


plot_p_stats('NAME_CASH_LOAN_PURPOSE', True, True)


# Besides not identifed/not available categories, *Repairs*, *Other*, *Urgent needs*, *Buying a used car*, *Building a house or an annex* accounts for the largest number of contracts.
# 
# 
# In terms of percent of defaults for current applications in the sample, clients with history of previous applications have largest percents of defaults when in their history are previous applications for cash loans for *Refusal to name the goal* - ~23% (which makes a lot of sense), *Hobby* (20%), *Car repairs* (~18%).

# ### Contract status
# 
# Let's look to the contract status.

# In[ ]:


plot_p_stats('NAME_CONTRACT_STATUS', True, True)


# Most previous applications contract statuses are *Approved* (~850K), *Canceled* and *Refused* (~240K). There are only ~20K in status *Unused offer*.
# 
# In terms of percent of defaults for current applications in the sample, clients with history of previous applications have largest percents of defaults when in their history contract statuses are *Refused* (12%), followed by *Canceled* (9%), *Unused offer* (~8%) and *Approved* (lowest percent of defaults in current applictions, with less than 8%).

# ### Payment type
# 
# Let's check the payment type.

# In[ ]:


plot_p_stats('NAME_PAYMENT_TYPE', True, True)


# Most of the previous applications were paid with *Cash through the bank* (~850K). Payments using *Non-cash from your account* or *Cashless from the account of the employer* are much rare. These three types of payments in previous applications results in allmost the same percent of defaults for current clients (~8% each).

# ### Client type
# 
# Let's check the client type for previous applications.

# In[ ]:


plot_p_stats('NAME_CLIENT_TYPE')


# Most of the previous applications have client type *Repeater* (~1M), just over 200K are *New* and ~100K are *Refreshed*.
# 
# In terms of default percent for current applications of clients with history of previous applications, current clients with previous applications have values of percent of defaults ranging from from 8.5%, 8.25% and 7% corresponding to client types in the past *New*, *Repeater* and *Refreshed*, respectivelly.
