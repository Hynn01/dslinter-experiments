# Two Sigma Financial News Competition is a unique competitions: not only it is a Kernel-only competition, but we aren't supposed to download data and during stage two our solutions will be used to predict future real data.
# 
# I'll try to do an extensive EDA for this competition and try to find some interesting things about the data.
# 
# P. S. I'l learning to use plotly, so there will be interactive charts at last!

# Fluctuations seem to be high, but in fact they are lower that 8 percent. In fact it looks like a random noise...

# Now let's remember the description:
# ```
# The marketdata contains a variety of returns calculated over different timespans. All of the returns in this set of marketdata have these properties:
# 
#     Returns are always calculated either open-to-open (from the opening time of one trading day to the open of another) or close-to-close (from the closing time of one trading day to the open of another).
#     Returns are either raw, meaning that the data is not adjusted against any benchmark, or market-residualized (Mktres), meaning that the movement of the market as a whole has been accounted for, leaving only movements inherent to the instrument.
#     Returns can be calculated over any arbitrary interval. Provided here are 1 day and 10 day horizons.
#     Returns are tagged with 'Prev' if they are backwards looking in time, or 'Next' if forwards looking.
# ```
# 
# Let's have a look at means of these variables.
