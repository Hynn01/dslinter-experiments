# # Bayesian hyperparameter tuning of xgBoost
# I took the features generated in my [previous notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/nanomathias/feature-engineering-importance-testing) and tried to tune a xgBoost model to those features using bayesian optimization. I ran the code locally for a few days, after which it had found some good parameters which gave a score of 0.9769 (using all the features of the previous notebook) - this worked out well for me, since I do not have a lot of time to actively work on trying out different models etc, but letting a script like this run for a few days to find good parameters is easy :)

# ## Example 1: xgBoost Parameter Tuning with Scikit-Optimize
# The following code is exactly what I used to tune the parameters - only difference is that I ran with the last 20 million samples in training set, and used the features from [previous notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/nanomathias/feature-engineering-importance-testing) instead of the raw features as done here. First I'll load the needed libraries and data.

import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb
import lightgbm as lgb
from skopt import BayesSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold

# SETTINGS - CHANGE THESE TO GET SOMETHING MEANINGFUL
ITERATIONS = 10 # 1000
TRAINING_SIZE = 100000 # 20000000
TEST_SIZE = 25000

# Load data
X = pd.read_csv(
    '../input/train.csv', 
    skiprows=range(1,184903891-TRAINING_SIZE), 
    nrows=TRAINING_SIZE,
    parse_dates=['click_time']
)

# Split into X and y
y = X['is_attributed']
X = X.drop(['click_time','is_attributed', 'attributed_time'], axis=1)


# To do the bayesian parameter tuning, I use the [BayesSearchCV](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/#skopt.BayesSearchCV) class of scikit-optimize. It works basically as a drop-in replacement for GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV, but generally I get better results with it. In the following I define the BayesSearchCV object, and write a short convenience function that will be used during optimization to output current status of the tuning. Locally I have access to more cores and run with n_jobs=4 for the classifier, and n_jobs=6 for the BayesSearchCV object.

# ## Example 3: Different cross-validators
# Some people have asked about CV strategy, and as seen I've just used the basic Stratified K-fold strategy; that was however mostly due to time constraints, and thus me not thinking that much about it. There are a lot of potentially better options, especially considering the temporal nature of this problem. Adding these are really easy using scikit-learn cross-validators; you just plug-n-play a new cross-validator into the `cv = ` options of BayesSearchCV. Examples could be a single train-test split, where we e.g. use one day for training, and one for testing (adjust accordingly):

# In[6]:


from sklearn.model_selection import PredefinedSplit

# Training [index == -1], testing [index == 0])
test_fold = np.zeros(len(X))
test_fold[:(TRAINING_SIZE-TEST_SIZE)] = -1
cv = PredefinedSplit(test_fold)

# Check that we only have a single train-test split, and the size
train_idx, test_idx = next(cv.split())
print(f"Splits: {cv.get_n_splits()}, Train size: {len(train_idx)}, Test size: {len(test_idx)}")


# Alternatively, we could want to use the [TimeSeriesSplit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html#sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit) cross-validator, which allows us to do several "into the future folds" for predictions

# In[14]:


from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit

# Here we just do 3-fold timeseries CV
cv = TimeSeriesSplit(max_train_size=None, n_splits=3)

# Let us check the sizes of the folds. Note that you can keep train size constant with max_train_size if needed
for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(cv.split(X)):
    print(f"Split {i+1} / {cv.get_n_splits()}:, Train size: {len(train_index)}, Test size: {len(test_index)}")


# ## Optimal xgBoost parameters
# ![](http://)After a few days of running for xgBoost, it found the following optimal parameters. Again, note that these gave me a 0.9769 score on [these features](https://www.kaggle.com/nanomathias/feature-engineering-importance-testing) and not the raw features, by training on the entire training set.
