# > ### *Women in tech didn't matter to people until tech started mattering to people: RachelÂ Sklar*
# 
# In the last few years, a lot of effort has being made in society to increase women's representation in the tech world. The idea behind these efforts is that attracting and retaining more women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will ultimately enhance innovation and creativity. When women are not involved in these fields, experiences, needs, and desires that are unique to women may be overlooked.
# 
# It is not that there aren't any female role models out there to inspire us.
# Do you remember the iconic photograph of** Katie Bouman in 2019**, watching the black hole's first photograph as it was being reconstructed? Not only was it a breakthrough moment for the scientific community, but an equally proud one for all the women scientists all over the world. A historic moment not just for science, but for women in science, too.
#

# 
# Similarly, women have also been making significant contributions to the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science. Be it **Margaret Hamilton** or **Grace Hopper** in the past or** Corinna Cortes** and **Fei Fei Li** today; women have made their presence felt with their work. More and more girls are being motivated to take up science and research in school and colleges. A lot of companies today are coming forward to change the world of work. This year, even the United Nations celebrated International Women's Day under the official theme **#BalanceforBetter**, advocating a more gender-balanced world.
# 
# However, as it may seem, not everything is still so "gung-ho" when it comes to women's representation is the Data Science field. The ratios are still skewed, and women still occupy far fewer leadership roles than men. But let's not just assume things but rather use data to verify our assumptions, and the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS survey is an excellent place to start. Let the numbers speak for themselves.
# 
# ## Objective
# The objective of this notebook to analyze the survey data to answer an important question: is the women participation in STEM really improving, or is it just a hype? Let's use our analysis skills to investigate whether things seem to be actually improving or is still much left to be done.
# 
# ## The Annual KaggleÂ survey
# Kaggle's annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey is in its third year now. This year, as in [2017](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017) and [2018](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018/), Kaggle has conducted an industry-wide survey that presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The Survey Challenges from 2017 and 2018 were very informative, and so is expected out of the 2019 survey too.
# 
# ## Methodology
# This notebook will only focus on the women in ML and DS, thereby analyzing the answers of the female respondents solely. The analysis will be two-fold:
# 
# * Analysis of the 2019 Kaggle DS & ML survey for Female respondents.
# * Comparisons of the results in the 2019 study with the previous two surveys. This will present a better picture and show whether are things are improving for real or not.
# 
# In this notebook, we shall analyze the female participation in the survey under six different categories, namely:

# 
# Analyzing data under these different categories should give us a fair idea of the nature of women's representation is the ML and DS realm.

# > * To encourage more people to take part and hence, complete surveys, specific innovative steps can be taken. People usually do not like lengthy surveys, especially which expects them to write detailed answers.

# 
# > **ðŸ“Œ Points to noteÂ :**
# > * Well, the pattern almost remains the same. Women respondents have been consistently low over the years. With this low participation, it gets really for our ideas and suggestions to be incorporated in the industry.Â 
# **Common girls!! we need more participation**
# > * The challenge of getting and keeping women in tech and data science goes well beyond educational exposure and will require some concrete steps from the establishments. Gender shouldn't limit accomplishments and opportunities for anyone.

# * This is a good sign for India as a country since the percentage of participation was more than last year. On the underhand, steps could be taken to analyze why the participation of U.S women declined, who were leading from the past two years.

# * The majority of female respondents did not wish to disclose their annual salary. Of the remaining, (~10%) have an annual salary of fewer than 1000 dollars. This makes sense since a major chunk of that population is students who may currently not be having permanent jobs.Â 
# * The next common salary range is (1kâ€“2k) dollars and (10k-15k) dollars. It appears that the salary range of females in 2019 is highly varied.
# * There is also a tiny percentage of females who make more than 200k and 300k dollars a year.

# > **ðŸ“Œ Points to noteÂ :**
# * There are definitely salary differences between the U.S and other countries. Data Scientists in U.S are paid relatively higher than in other countries.
# * The majority of Female Data Scientists in the U.S earn between 100â€“200k USD, while a lot of Data Scientists in India earn less than 1000 dollars a year. Indian Data Scientists are highly underpaid as compared to other countries.
# * The proportion of Data Scientists earning more than 100k annually is also higher than in her countries.

# # <a>Key Takeaways and Recommendations</a>
# 
# Some of the significant takeaways from this entire exercise can be summed up in six key points:
# 
# * The participation of women in this survey is very low and hasn't shown much improvement over the years. We need to see the reason behind such low participation and how we can encourage women to become more participative. Networking can be a great way for women to connect with other fellow women and help and encourage others. A lot of support groups are present which help to create a friendly and supportive environment for Women in Data Science where they can share knowledge, develop skills and also help others in finding jobs and advance their careers. Some of these groups are:
# >
#     * [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/)
#     * [Women in Machine Learning & Data Science](http://wimlds.org/)
#     * [Women in Tech Summit](https://womenintechsummit.net/)
#     * [Black Women in Computing](http://blackwomenincomputing.org/)
#     * [Rladies Global](https://rladies.org/)
#     * [PyLadies](https://www.pyladies.com/)
#     * [EdTechWomen](http://edtechwomen.com/chapters-and-events)
#     * [Widening Natural Language Processing](http://www.winlp.org/mission/)
#     * [Women in Big Data](https://www.womeninbigdata.org/)
#     
# 
# * The response from the U.S and Indian women is really heartening, although it is still very low as compared to their male counterparts. Africa shows a glimmer of hope with countries like Nigeria and Algeria gearing up. Organizations should team up with the African government and NGOs to provide better opportunities for study and research to these women.
# * The young female populations in Data Science are on the rise with the majority coming from India. This is not surprising as India has one of the highest young brigades in the world. This demographic dividend should be tapped efficiently by reforming the existing Indian education model and introducing high-quality Data science courses in their existing curriculum.
# * The females in the  Science space are highly qualified with the majority having a Master's degree.Â 
# * Most of the female Data Scientists are located in the U.S and India. Some women who are not employed have also responded to the survey. There could be multiple reasons for that. They could be students or women who wish to restart their careers after a break. The latter could be provided with assistance by getting them to attend meetups or community events. For the students, a mentorship is a good option.
# * The salary distribution has remained constant over the years but Indian female Data Scientists are paid comparatively less as compared to their counterparts in the U.S.
# 
# 
# 
# # <a>Conclusion</a>
# 
# So let's get back to the initial questionâ€Š-â€ŠAre the Geek Girls Rising? It's a mixed feeling. Some areas have shown improvement while a lot of work is required in others. Overall, things appear to be promising and if we could work towards it, future will be better than it is today.
# Data science in itself is a combination of diverse scientific disciplines. It makes all the more sense to bring in people from different genders, backgrounds, and ethnicity. This way we can bring in more creativity and allow knowledge, discoveries, and innovation to flourish.Â 
# It will require a collaborative effort from society to make diversity and inclusion a vital part of the ecosystem. As women, we should also make sure that we create a strong support group among ourselves to assist our fellow females in the Data Science and STEM space. Afterall **Empowered women, empower women**.
