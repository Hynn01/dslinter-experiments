# **About Kiva:**
# [Kiva](https://www.kiva.org/about) is an international nonprofit, founded in 2005 and based in San Francisco, with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty.
# Kiva is in 83 countries, with about 2.7 Million borrowers. Kiva has funded around 1.11 Billion USD worth of loans. It also has around 450 volunteers worldwide. 
# 
# **Objective of the dataset:**
# Pair Kiva's data with additional data sources to estimate the welfare level of borrowers in specific regions, based on shared economic and demographic characteristics.
# 
# **Objective of the notebook:**
# To get a better understanding of the data provided by Kiva and also to discuss ideas for additional data sources. Most of the plots are done using plotly and so will be interactive. Please feel free to hover over the plots to get more insights.
