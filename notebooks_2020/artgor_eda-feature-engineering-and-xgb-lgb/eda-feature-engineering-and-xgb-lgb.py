# We can see several things from this overview:
# - There is a variety of features: numerical, categorical, text and date;
# - Only teacher prefix column has missing values;
# - project_essay_3 and project_essay_4 columns also have missing values, but this is a special case, we will talk about it later;
# - Some texts have '\n' and '\r' symbols, so they'll need to be cleaned;
# - Several categorical features have a lot of unique values;
# - Some teachers have submitted more than 70 projects;
# - 10183 rows are duplicate. We'll need to drop them;

# ### Feature analysis
# 
# We saw a lot of information about features, so let's now analyze each of them in more details.

# ### Essays

# Starting on May 17, 2016, the number of essays was reduced from 4 to 2. Essentially old 1 and 2 became new 1 and old 3 and 4 became new 2. This means that columns 'project_essay_3' and 'project_essay_4' have NaN values since that date. Let's see the number of projects before and after this date.

# In[ ]:


print('Projests before 2016-05-17:', np.sum(train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date < datetime.date(2016, 5, 7)))
print('Projests after 2016-05-17:', np.sum(train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date >= datetime.date(2016, 5, 7)))


# So only 3751 (or 2%) of all projects were submitted before this date. We have several options here: split dataset into two parts and train different models on them, drop samples before this date, combine 1 with 2 and 3 with 4 for old samples or do nothing. I prefer combining old samples.

# In[ ]:


train.loc[train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date < datetime.date(2016, 5, 7), 'project_essay_1'] = train.loc[train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date < datetime.date(2016, 5, 7), 'project_essay_1'] + ' ' + train.loc[train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date < datetime.date(2016, 5, 7), 'project_essay_2']
train.loc[train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date < datetime.date(2016, 5, 7), 'project_essay_2'] = train.loc[train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date < datetime.date(2016, 5, 7), 'project_essay_3'] + ' ' + train.loc[train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date < datetime.date(2016, 5, 7), 'project_essay_4']

# ### project_resource_summary

# ### teacher_prefix

# In[ ]:


train.teacher_prefix.value_counts(dropna=False)


# In[ ]:


pd.crosstab(train.teacher_prefix, train.project_is_approved, dropna=False, normalize='index')


# We can see that there are much more female teachers than male, which is normal. And it seems that project approval rate is independent from teacher gender. If anything writing title could lead to lesser chances.

# In[ ]:


#Let's fill missing values with most common one.
train['teacher_prefix'].fillna('Mrs.', inplace=True)


# ### school_state

# In[ ]:


train.groupby('school_state').agg({'project_is_approved': ['mean', 'count']}).reset_index().sort_values([('project_is_approved', 'mean')], ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)


# As we can see states have a similar approval rate ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. And this rate doesn't depend on the number of projects.

# ### project_submitted_datetime

# At first let's create new features based on project_submitted_datetime: date, weekday and day of month. 

# In[ ]:


train['date'] = train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.date
train['weekday'] = train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.weekday
train['day'] = train.project_submitted_datetime.dt.day
count_by_date = train.groupby('date')['project_is_approved'].count()

# It could be interesting to see trends:

# In[ ]:

plt.title("Trends of approval rates and number of projects")
count_by_date.rolling(window=12,center=False).mean().plot(ax=ax1, legend=False)

plt.grid(False)


# As we can see, we don't have even one year of data, so it is diffucult to make good conclusions about long-term trends, but let's try to make some observations:
# - At the very beginning, when teachers had to write 4 essays, the number of projects was quite low, but the approval rate was the highest;
# - Then approval rate began rapidly declining. Maybe teachers weren't able to adapt to new rules fast enough, and as a result they weren't able to meet new criteria?
# - There are two huge spikes in the number of submitted projects: at the beginning of August and September. I suppose that teachers requested new supplies for the beginning of new school year;
# - And in 2017 we can see a downtrend both in the number of submitted projects and approval rates;

# In[ ]:

plt.grid(False)


# We can see that number of submissions is the highest on Wednesday and then lowers on weekends.

# ### project_grade_category

# In[ ]:


pd.crosstab(train.project_grade_category, train.project_is_approved, dropna=False, normalize='index')


# It seems that project approval is independent from project grade category.

# ### project_subject_categories and project_subject_subcategories
# Project categories and subcategories often have several subjects divided by ",". Let's see the number of real subjects.

# In[ ]:


psc = [i.split(', ') for i in train.project_subject_categories.values]
psc = [i for j in psc for i in j]
print('Common subject categories.')
Counter(psc).most_common()


# In[ ]:


pss = [i.split(', ') for i in train.project_subject_subcategories.values]
pss = [i for j in pss for i in j]

Counter(pss).most_common()


# ### teacher_number_of_previously_posted_projects

# In[ ]:


train.groupby('teacher_number_of_previously_posted_projects')['project_is_approved'].mean().plot()


# We can see that the more projects were submitted by a techer, the higher are chances for approval.

# ### Resources

# Let's transform the data:
# - create cost column which will show total cost of the item (quantity * price);
# - group data by project id and show aggregate values;

# In[ ]:


resources['cost'] = resources['quantity'] * resources['price']
resources_aggregated = resources.groupby('id').agg({'description': ['nunique'], 'quantity': ['sum'], 'cost': ['mean', 'sum']})
resources_aggregated.columns = ['unique_items', 'total_quantity', 'mean_cost', 'total_cost']
resources_aggregated.reset_index(inplace=True)
resources_aggregated.head()


# In[ ]:


print('99 percentile is {0}.'.format(np.percentile(resources_aggregated.mean_cost, 99)))
plt.boxplot(resources_aggregated.mean_cost);


# We can see that prices are heavily skewed. Let's try using boxcox transformation.

# In[ ]:


resources_aggregated['mean_cost'] = stats.boxcox(resources_aggregated.mean_cost + 1)[0]
plt.hist(resources_aggregated.mean_cost);
plt.title('Transformed mean cost');


# As we can see boxcox transformation is very useful in such cases. Let's try to do the same for other columns.

# In[ ]:


resources_aggregated['unique_items'] = stats.boxcox(resources_aggregated.unique_items + 1)[0]
plt.hist(resources_aggregated.unique_items);
plt.title('Transformed number of unique items');


# In[ ]:


resources_aggregated['total_quantity'] = stats.boxcox(resources_aggregated.total_quantity + 1)[0]
plt.hist(resources_aggregated.total_quantity);
plt.title('Transformed total quantity');


# In[ ]:


resources_aggregated['total_cost'] = stats.boxcox(resources_aggregated.total_cost + 1)[0]

# ## Models
# When we think about common classification and regression problems, XGBoost and LightGBM are most commonly used models. I'll use both of them and the prediction will be their average.

# In[ ]:


params = {'eta': 0.05, 'max_depth': 15, 'objective': 'binary:logistic', 'eval_metric': 'auc', 'seed': 42, 'silent': True, 'colsample':0.9}
watchlist = [(xgb.DMatrix(X_train, y_train), 'train'), (xgb.DMatrix(X_valid, y_valid), 'valid')]
model = xgb.train(params, xgb.DMatrix(X_train, y_train), 1000,  watchlist, verbose_eval=10, early_stopping_rounds=20)


# In[ ]:


submission['project_is_approved'] = model.predict(xgb.DMatrix(X_test_full), ntree_limit=model.best_ntree_limit)


# In[ ]:


params = {'learning_rate': 0.05, 'max_depth': 14, 'boosting': 'gbdt', 'objective': 'binary', 'metric': 'auc', 'is_training_metric': True, 'seed': 42}
model2 = lgb.train(params, lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train), 1000, lgb.Dataset(X_valid, label=y_valid), verbose_eval=10, early_stopping_rounds=20)


# In[ ]:


submission['project_is_approved'] += model2.predict(X_test_full, num_iteration=model2.best_iteration)
submission['project_is_approved'] = submission['project_is_approved'] / 2
submission.to_csv('xgb_lgb.csv', index=False)


# ## Conclusions
# 
# In this kernel I did EDA, feature engineering and used xgboost with lightgbm to make predictions. Here are some ideas to improve the quality of predictions:
# - generate more features based on continuous variables, for example mean price and quantity of items in a project;
# - tune tf-idf vectorizer parameters;
# - make careful features selection;
# - tune model parameters and blend more models;
# - etc.
# 
# I hope that this notebook was interesting! Feedback is welcomed and appreciated!
