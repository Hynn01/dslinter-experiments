# I have been struggling for a while on how to spell check questions while only using allowed data/software.  Here is the solution I am using now.
# 
# It is an adaptation of Peter Norvig's spell checker.  It uses word2vec ordering of words to approximate word probabilities.  Indeed, Google word2vec apparently orders words in decreasing order of frequency in the training corpus.
# 
# This kernel requires to download Google's word2vec: https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors .  I have put it in my ../data directory.
# 
# I don't think that  the notebooks can run on Kaggle kernels but I share it anyway as many have already downloaded the word2vec embedding.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# That's it. If you have downloaded word2vec then you can start using this code.  Here are few examples of what it does.
# 
# correction('quikly') returns quickly
# 
# correction('israil') returns israel
# 
# correction('neighbour') returns neighbor
