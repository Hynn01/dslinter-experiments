# 	abstract = {The world has faced the devastating outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19, in 2020. Research in the subject matter was fast-tracked to such a point that scientists were struggling to keep up with new findings. With this increase in the scientific literature, there arose a need for organizing those documents. We describe an approach to organize and visualize the scientific literature on or related to COVID-19 using machine learning techniques so that papers on similar topics are grouped together. By doing so, the navigation of topics and related papers is simplified. We implemented this approach using the widely recognized CORD-19 dataset to present a publicly available proof of concept.},

# # Goal
# Given the large number of literature and the rapid spread of COVID-19, it is difficult for health professionals to keep up with new information on the virus. Can clustering similar research articles together simplify the search for related publications? How can the content of the clusters be qualified?
# 
# By using clustering for labeling in combination with dimensionality reduction for visualization, the collection of literature can be represented by a scatter plot. On this plot, publications of highly similar topics will share a label and will be plotted near each other. In order, to find meaning in the clusters, topic modeling will be performed to find the keywords of each cluster.
# 
# By using Bokeh, the plot will be interactive. Users will have the option of seeing the plot as a whole or filtering the data by cluster. If a narrower scope is required, the plot will also have a search function that will limit the output to only papers containing the search term. Hovering over points on the plot will give basic information like title, author, journal, and abstract. Clicking on a point will bring up a menu with a URL that can be used to access the full publication.
# 
# This is a difficult time in which health care workers, sanitation staff, and much other essential personnel are out there keeping the world afloat. Sitting at home has given us time to try to help in our own way. We hope that our work will have some impact on the fight against COVID-19. It should be noted, however, that we are not epidemiologists, and it is not our place to gauge the importance of these papers. This tool was created to help make it easier for trained professionals to sift through many, many publications related to the virus, and find their own determinations.

# # Approach:
# 
# - Parse the text from the body of each document using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
# - Turn each document instance di into a feature vector Xi using Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
# - Apply Dimensionality Reduction to each feature vector Xi using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to cluster similar research articles in the two-dimensional plane X embedding Y1.
# - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to project down the dimensions of X to several dimensions that will keep .95 variance while removing noise and outliers in embedding Y2.
# - Apply k-means clustering on Y2, where k is 20, to label each cluster on Y1.
# - Apply Topic Modeling on X using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover keywords from each cluster.
# - Investigate the clusters visually on the plot, zooming down to specific articles as needed, and via classification using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

# # Dimensionality Reduction with t-SNE

# The labeled plot gives better insight into how the papers are grouped. Interestingly, both k-means and t-SNE can find independent clusters even though they were run independently. This shows that structure within the literature can be observed and measured to some extent. 
# 
# Now there are other cases where the colored labels are spread out on the plot. This is a result of t-SNE and k-means finding different connections in the higher dimensional data. The topics of these papers often intersect so it was hard to cleanly separate them. 

# # Topic Modeling on Each Cluster
# 
# Now we will attempt to find the most significant words in each cluster. K-means clustered the articles but did not label the topics. Through topic modeling, we will find out what the most important terms for each cluster are. This will add more meaning to the cluster by giving keywords to quickly identify the themes of the cluster.

# For topic modeling, we will use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). In LDA, each document can be described by a distribution of topics and each topic can be described by a distribution of words[.](https://towardsdatascience.com/light-on-math-machine-learning-intuitive-guide-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation-437c81220158)

# # Plotting the data
# The previous steps have given us clustering labels and a dataset of papers reduced to two dimensions. By pairing this with Bokeh, we can create an interactive plot of the literature. This should organize the papers such that related publications are nearby. To try to understand what the similarities may be, we have also performed topic modeling on each cluster of papers to pick out the key terms.

# # Conclusion
# In this project, we have attempted to cluster published literature on COVID-19 and reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for visualization purposes. This has allowed for an interactive scatter plot of papers related to COVID-19, in which material of similar themes is grouped. Grouping the literature in this way allows for professionals to quickly find material related to a central topic. Instead of having to manually search for related work, every publication is connected to a larger topic cluster. [...]
#  
# The clustering of the data was done through k-means on a pre-processed, vectorized version of the literatureâ€™s body text. As k-means simply split the data into clusters, topic modeling through LDA was performed to identify keywords. This gave the topics that were prevalent in each of the clusters.
# 
# K-means and t-SNE were able to independently find clusters, showing that relationships between papers can be identified and measured. Papers written on highly similar topics are typically near each other on the plot and bear the same k-means label. However, due to the complexity of the dataset, k-means and t-SNE will sometimes arrive at different decisions. The topics of much of the given literature are continuous and will not have a concrete decision boundary. In these conditions, our approach performs quite well to organize the literature by similarity. 
# 
# - Look at clusters
# - Look at titles/abstract to see that they are similar
# - Use classification to see if k-means found effective decisions
# 
# As neither of the authors is qualified to assess the meaning of the literature, the analysis by inspection was performed solely on the titles. Even so, it was apparent that articles on key topics could be easily found near each other. For example [MASK CLUSTER EXAMPLE FROM FINAL PLOT].  We believe that health professionals can use this tool to find real links in the texts. By organizing the literature, qualified people can quickly find related publications that answer the task questions. 
# 
# "This project can further be improved by abstracting the underlying data analysis techniques as described in this notebook to develop a user interface/tool that presents the related articles in a user-friendly manner."
# 
# <br>
# <br>
# <br>

# **Some areas we thought were great:** (pros)
# - The tool is saved as an HTML file. It can be downloaded and used locally/offline.
# - It is portable/mobile, easily deployable, and failover safe; the risk of denial of service in the case of emergencies such as the loss of network connection is mitigated
# - Dimensionality reduction allows for the whole dataset to be easily accessible. The papers are all up on the plot and can be quickly examined by hovering over them. If the abstract seems interesting, the user can click on the point to bring up a text box with more information that will contain a link to the full paper
# - Patterns in the data found through clustering/dimensionality reduction may not be readily apparent to researchers. These unsupervised techniques can show humans hidden connections in the literature
# - If the topics/clusters are not narrow enough for the user, a search for a key term will only bring up papers that contain the search term. Search can be performed inside of a selected cluster or the entire dataset if preferred.
# - A surface-level examination of the plot showed some very interesting organization of the data. For example, one subcluster consisted of papers that tried to determine the efficacy of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
# - This work can be easily replicated and modified as needed, serving as a foundation for future projects.
# 
# <br>
# 
# **Future thoughts to consider:** (cons)
# - Possible false positives, difficult to draw an exact line between subjects
# - K-means and t-SNE are unsupervised approaches that will not necessarily predictably group instances. Due to their unsupervised nature, this is not an exact science 
# - Not labeled data; no certainty.
# - No in between, clustering either looks ok or is very wrong
# - Loss of foreign language papers. This leads to the loss of experience from different geographic locations in dealing with COVID-19
# - The algorithms used in this notebook are stochastic so the results may vary depending on the random state. In this notebook, all of the algorithms are set to random state 42 (the meaning of life) to ensure reproducible results
