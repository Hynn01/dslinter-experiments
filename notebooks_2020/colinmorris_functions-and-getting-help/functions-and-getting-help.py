# You've already seen and used functions such as `print` and `abs`. But Python has many more functions, and defining your own functions is a big part of python programming.
# 
# In this lesson, you will learn more about using and defining functions.

# # Getting Help
# 
# You saw the `abs` function in the previous tutorial, but what if you've forgotten what it does?
# 
# The `help()` function is possibly the most important Python function you can learn. If you can remember how to use `help()`, you hold the key to understanding most other functions.
# 
# Here is an example:

# In[ ]:


help(round)


# `help()` displays two things:
# 
# 1. the header of that function `round(number, ndigits=None)`. In this case, this tells us that `round()` takes an argument we can describe as `number`. Additionally, we can optionally give a separate argument which could be described as `ndigits`.
# 2. A brief English description of what the function does. 

# **Common pitfall:** when you're looking up a function, remember to pass in the name of the function itself, and not the result of calling that function. 
# 
# What happens if we invoke help on a *call* to the function `round()`? Unhide the output of the cell below to see.

# In[ ]:


help(round(-2.01))


# Python evaluates an expression like this from the inside out. First it calculates the value of `round(-2.01)`, then it provides help on the output of that expression.
# 
# <small>(And it turns out to have a lot to say about integers! After we talk later about objects, methods, and attributes in Python, the help output above will make more sense.)</small>
# 
# `round` is a very simple function with a short docstring. `help` shines even more when dealing with more complex, configurable functions like `print`. Don't worry if the following output looks inscrutable... for now, just see if you can pick anything new out from this help.

# In[ ]:


help(print)


# If you were looking for it, you might learn that print can take an argument called `sep`, and that this describes what we put between all the other arguments when we print them.

# ## Defining functions
# 
# Builtin functions are great, but we can only get so far with them before we need to start defining our own functions. Below is a simple example.

# In[ ]:


def least_difference(a, b, c):
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)


# This creates a function called `least_difference`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
# 
# Functions start with a header introduced by the `def` keyword. The indented block of code following the `:` is run when the function is called.
# 
# `return` is another keyword uniquely associated with functions. When Python encounters a `return` statement, it exits the function immediately, and passes the value on the right hand side to the calling context.
# 
# Is it clear what `least_difference()` does from the source code? If we're not sure, we can always try it out on a few examples:

# In[ ]:


print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7), # Python allows trailing commas in argument lists. How nice is that?
)


# Or maybe the `help()` function can tell us something about it.

# In[ ]:


help(least_difference)


# Python isn't smart enough to read my code and turn it into a nice English description. However, when I write a function, I can provide a description in what's called the **docstring**.
# 
# ### Docstrings

# In[ ]:


def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    
    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1, diff2, diff3)


# The docstring is a triple-quoted string (which may span multiple lines) that comes immediately after the header of a function. When we call `help()` on a function, it shows the docstring.

# In[ ]:


help(least_difference)


# > **Aside:**
# > The last two lines of the docstring are an example function call and result. (The `>>>` is a reference to the command prompt used in Python interactive shells.) Python doesn't run the example call - it's just there for the benefit of the reader. The convention of including 1 or more example calls in a function's docstring is far from universally observed, but it can be very effective at helping someone understand your function. For a real-world example, see [this docstring for the numpy function `np.eye`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.14.2/numpy/lib/twodim_base.py#L140-L194).

# Good programmers use docstrings unless they expect to throw away the code soon after it's used (which is rare).  So, you should start writing docstrings, too!

# ## Functions that don't return
# 
# What would happen if we didn't include the `return` keyword in our function?

# In[ ]:


def least_difference(a, b, c):
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers
    among a, b and c.
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    min(diff1, diff2, diff3)
    
print(
    least_difference(1, 10, 100),
    least_difference(1, 10, 10),
    least_difference(5, 6, 7),
)


# Python allows us to define such functions. The result of calling them is the special value `None`. (This is similar to the concept of "null" in other languages.)
# 
# Without a `return` statement, `least_difference` is completely pointless, but a function with side effects may do something useful without returning anything. We've already seen two examples of this: `print()` and `help()` don't return anything. We only call them for their side effects (putting some text on the screen). Other examples of useful side effects include writing to a file, or modifying an input.

# In[ ]:


mystery = print()
print(mystery)


# ## Default arguments
# 
# When we called `help(print)`, we saw that the `print` function has several optional arguments. For example, we can specify a value for `sep` to put some special string in between our printed arguments:

# In[ ]:


print(1, 2, 3, sep=' < ')


# But if we don't specify a value, `sep` is treated as having a default value of `' '` (a single space).

# In[ ]:


print(1, 2, 3)


# Adding optional arguments with default values to the functions we define turns out to be pretty easy:

# In[ ]:


def greet(who="Colin"):
    print("Hello,", who)
    
greet()
greet(who="Kaggle")
# (In this case, we don't need to specify the name of the argument, because it's unambiguous.)
greet("world")


# ## Functions Applied to Functions
# 
# Here's something that's powerful, though it can feel very abstract at first.  You can supply functions as arguments to other functions.  Some example may make this clearer:

# In[ ]:


def mult_by_five(x):
    return 5 * x

def call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on arg"""
    return fn(arg)

def squared_call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on the result of calling fn on arg"""
    return fn(fn(arg))

print(
    call(mult_by_five, 1),
    squared_call(mult_by_five, 1), 
    sep='\n', # '\n' is the newline character - it starts a new line
)


# Functions that operate on other functions are called "higher-order functions." You probably won't write your own for a little while. But there are higher-order functions built into Python that you might find useful to call. 
# 
# Here's an interesting example using the `max` function.
# 
# By default, `max` returns the largest of its arguments. But if we pass in a function using the optional `key` argument, it returns the argument `x` that maximizes `key(x)` (aka the 'argmax').

# In[ ]:


def mod_5(x):
    """Return the remainder of x after dividing by 5"""
    return x % 5

print(
    'Which number is biggest?',
    max(100, 51, 14),
    'Which number is the biggest modulo 5?',
    max(100, 51, 14, key=mod_5),
    sep='\n',
)
