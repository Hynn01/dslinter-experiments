# * Hi guys, I hope you are doing fine. 
# * In this kernel, we use multipla data sources that are **aerial bombing  operations** and **weather conditions in world war 2**.
# * After this point, I will use acronym ww2 for world war 2.
# * We will start with **data description and cleaning**, then we will visualize our data to understand better. These processes can be called **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.
# * After that, we will focus on **time series prediction** to predict when bombing operations are done. 
# * For time series prediction, we will use **ARIMA** method that will be a tutorial.

# ## Load the Data
# * As I mentioned at introduction, we use multiple data sources.
#     * Aerial Bombing Operations in WW2
#         * Shortly, this data includes bombing operations. For example, USA who use ponte olivo airfield bomb Germany (Berlin) with A36 air craft in 1945.
#     * Wether Conditions in WW2
#         * Shortly, weather conditions during ww2. For example, according to george town weather station, average temperature is 23.88 in 1/7/1942. 
#         * This data set has 2 subset in it. First one includes weather station locations like country, latitude and longitude.
#         * Second one includes measured min, max and mean temperatures from weather stations.

# ## Data Cleaning
# * Aerial  Bombing data includes a lot of NaN value. Instead of usign them, I drop some NaN values. It does not only remove the uncertainty but it also easa visualization process.
#     * Drop countries that are NaN
#     * Drop if target longitude is NaN
#     * Drop if takeoff longitude is NaN
#     * Drop unused features
# * Weather Condition data does not need any cleaning. According to exploratory data analysis and visualization, we will choose certain location to examine deeper. However, lets put our data variables what we use only.

# * Green line is mean temperature that is measured in Bindukuri.
# * Blue markers are bombing dates and bombing date temperature.
# * As it can be seen from plot, USA bomb at high temperatures.
#     * The question is that can we predict future weather and according to this prediction can we know whether bombing will be done or not.
#     * In order to answer this question lets first start with time series prediction.
#   

# <a id="5"></a> <br>
# ## Time Series Prediction with ARIMA
# * We will use most used method ARIMA
# * ARIMA :  AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. I will explain it detailed  at next parts.
# * The way that we will follow: 
#     * What is Time Series ?
#     * Stationarity of a Time Series
#     * Make a Time Series Stationary?
#     * Forecasting a Time Series

# <a id="6"></a> <br>
# ### What is time series?
# * Time series is a collection of data points that are collected at constant time intervals.
# * It is time dependent.
# * Most of time series have some form of **seasonality trends**. For example, if we sale ice cream, most probably there will be higher sales in summer seasons. Therefore, this time series has seasonality trends.
# * Another example, lets think we dice one time every day during 1 year. As you guess, there will be no scenario like that number six is appeared mostly in summer season or number five is mostly appeared in January. Therefore, this time series does not have seasonality trends.
# 

# <a id="7"></a> <br>
# ### Stationarity of a Time Series
# * There are three basic criterion for a time series to understand whether it is stationary series or not.
#     * Statistical properties of time series such as mean, variance should remain constant over time to call **time series is stationary**
#         * constant mean
#         * constant variance
#         * autocovariance that does not depend on time. autocovariance is covariance between time series and lagged time series.
# * Lets visualize and check seasonality trend of our time series.

# Mean temperature of Bindikuri area

plt.plot(weather_bin.Date,weather_bin.MeanTemp)

# lets create time series from weather 
timeSeries = weather_bin.loc[:, ["Date","MeanTemp"]]
timeSeries.index = timeSeries.Date
ts = timeSeries.drop("Date",axis=1)


# * As you can see from plot above, our time series has seasonal variation. In summer, mean temperature is higher and in winter mean temperature is lower for each year.
# * Now lets check stationary of time series. We can check stationarity using the following methods: 
#     * Plotting Rolling Statistics: We have a window lets say window size is 6 and then we find rolling mean and variance to check stationary.
#     * Dickey-Fuller Test: The test results comprise of a **Test Statistic** and some **Critical Values** for difference confidence levels. If the **test statistic** is less than the **critical value**, we can say that time series is stationary.

    result = adfuller(ts, autolag='AIC')
    print('Test statistic: ' , result[0])
    print('p-value: '  ,result[1])
    print('Critical Values:' ,result[4])
# check_mean_std
def check_mean_std(ts):
    #Rolling statistics
    rolmean = pd.rolling_mean(ts, window=6)
    rolstd = pd.rolling_std(ts, window=6)
    plt.figure(figsize=(22,10))   
    orig = plt.plot(ts, color='red',label='Original')
    mean = plt.plot(rolmean, color='black', label='Rolling Mean')

    plt.ylabel("Mean Temperature")

    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
    
# check stationary: mean, variance(std)and adfuller test
check_mean_std(ts)
check_adfuller(ts.MeanTemp)


# * Our first criteria for stationary is constant mean. So we fail because mean is not constant as you can see from plot(black line) above . (no stationary)
# * Second one is constant variance. It looks like constant. (yes stationary)
# * Third one is that If the **test statistic** is less than the **critical value**, we can say that time series is stationary. Lets look:
#     * test statistic = -1.4 and critical values = {'1%': -3.439229783394421, '5%': -2.86545894814762, '10%': -2.5688568756191392}. Test statistic is bigger than the critical values. (no stationary)
# * As a result, we sure that our time series is not stationary.
# * Lets make time series stationary at the next part.

# <a id="8"></a> <br>
# ### Make a Time Series Stationary?
# * As we mentioned before, there are 2  reasons behind non-stationarity of time series
#     * Trend: varying mean over time. We need constant mean for stationary of time series.
#     * Seasonality: variations at specific time. We need constant variations for stationary of time series.
# * First solve **trend(constant mean)** problem
#     * Most popular method is moving average.
#         * Moving average: We have window that take the average over the past 'n' sample. 'n' is window size.

# * Constant mean criteria: mean looks like constant as you can see from plot(black line) above . (yes stationary)
# * Second one is constant variance. It looks like constant. (yes stationary)
# * The test statistic is smaller than the 1% critical values so we can say with 99% confidence that this is a stationary series. (yes stationary)
# * We achieve stationary time series. However lets look at one more method to avoid trend and seasonality.
#     * Differencing method: It is one of the most common method. Idea is that take difference between time series and shifted time series.

# ### Forecasting a Time Series
# * We learn two different methodsthat are **moving average and differencing** methods to avoid trend and seasonality problem
# * For prediction(forecasting) we will use ts_diff time series that is result of differencing method. There is no reason I only choose it.
# * Also prediction method is ARIMA that is Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages.
#     * AR: Auto-Regressive (p): AR terms are just lags of dependent variable. For example lets say p is 3, we will use  x(t-1), x(t-2) and x(t-3) to predict x(t)
#     * I: Integrated (d): These are the number of nonseasonal differences. For example, in our case we take the first order difference. So we pass that variable and put d=0 
#     * MA: Moving Averages (q): MA terms are lagged forecast errors in prediction equation.
# * (p,d,q) is parameters of ARIMA model.
# * In order to choose p,d,q parameters we will use two different plots.
#     * Autocorrelation Function (ACF): Measurement of the correlation between time series and lagged version of time series. 
#     * Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF): This measures the correlation between the time series and lagged version of time series but after eliminating the variations already explained by the intervening comparisons.

# * Two dotted lines are the confidence interevals. We use these lines to determine the ‘p’ and ‘q’ values
#     * Choosing p: The lag value where the PACF chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time. p=1.
#     * Choosing q: The lag value where the ACF chart crosses the upper confidence interval for the first time. q=1.
# * Now lets use (1,0,1) as parameters of ARIMA models and predict  
#     * ARIMA: from statsmodels libarary
#     * datetime: we will use it start and end indexes of predict method
