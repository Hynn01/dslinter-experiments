# # Preface

# In this notebook I want to share some knowledge I gained since I wrote the popular preprocessing kernel for the Quora challenge https://www.kaggle.com/christofhenkel/how-to-preprocessing-when-using-embeddings
# 
# Since I am rather lazy, I forked Benjamins https://www.kaggle.com/bminixhofer/speed-up-your-rnn-with-sequence-bucketing to have a solid starting point. In the following I want to share 3 tricks that not only speed up the preprocessing a bit, but also improve a models accuracy. REMARK: Right after I finished I realized I run into memory issues if I do EDA and modelling in one kernel, so I'll have to split into 2 kernels. Sorry for that...
# 
# The 3 main contributions of this kernel are the following:
# 
# - loading embedding from pickles 
# - aimed preprocessing for GloVe and fasttext vectors (the main content of this notebook)
# - fixing some unknown words
# 
# What I will not cover are word-specific preprocessing steps like handling contractions, or mispellings (again, since I am rather lazy and do not want to hardcode dictionaries).
# 
# The neural network architecture is taken from the best scoring public kernel at the time of writing: [Simple LSTM with Identity Parameters - Fast AI](https://www.kaggle.com/kunwar31/simple-lstm-with-identity-parameters-fastai).

# ## Preprocessing

# ### Important remarks
# Let me start with some remarks, which I also made in the quora notebook:
# 
# 1.  **Don't naively use standard preprocessing steps like stemming, lowercasing or stopword removal when you have pre-trained embeddings** 
# 
# Some of you might used standard preprocessing steps when doing word count based feature extraction (e.g. TFIDF) such as removing stopwords, stemming etc. 
# The reason is simple: You loose valuable information, which would help your NN to figure things out.  
# 
# 2. **Get your vocabulary as close to the embeddings as possible**
# 
# I will focus in this notebook, how to achieve that.
# 
# Getting your vocabulary close to the pretrained embeddings means, that you should aim for your preprocessing to result in tokens that are mostly covered by word vectors. That leads to two conclusions:
# 
# 1. Setting up the preprocessing is some eda and research work
# 
# If a word vector for a token (see remark below for what I mean with token) is available strongly depends on the preprocessing used by the people who trained the embeddings. Unfortunatly most are quite intransparent about this point. (e.g. did they use lower casing, removing contractions, replacement of words, etc. So you need to research their github repositories and/or read the related papers. Did you now the Google pretrained word vectors replace numbers with "##" or the guys training glove twitter embeddings did `text = re.sub("<3", '<HEART>', text)` 
# That all leads to the second conclusion:
# 
# 2. Each pretrained embedding needs its own preprocessing
# 
# If people used different preprocessing for training their embeddings you would also need to do the same, 
# 
# 
# Especially point to can be quite challenging, if you want to concatenate embeddings as in this kernel. Imagine Embedding A preprocesses `"don't"` to a single token`["dont"]` and Embedding B to two tokens`["do","n't"]`. You are basically not able to do both. So you need to find a compromise.
# 
# 
# 
# *(most of the times token and word is the same, but sometimes e.g. "?", "n't" are not words, so I use the term token instead)

# Lets start with two function I mainly use for the EDA. The first one goes through a given vocabulary and tries to find word vectors in your embedding matrix. `build_vocab` builds a ordered dictionary of words and their frequency in your text corpus.

# 10s compared to 2min in the other public kernels ;) So lets build our vocab and check the embeddings coverage without any preprocessing.

# Seems like `'` and other punctuation directly on or in a word is an issue. We could simply delete punctuation to fix that words, but there are better methods. Lets explore the embeddings, in particular symbols a bit. For that we first need to define "what is a symbol" in contrast to a regular letter. I nowadays use the following list for "regular" letters. And symbols are all characters not in that list.

# So lets have closer look on what we just did. We printed all symbols that we have an embedding vector for. Intrestingly its not only a vast amount of punctuation but also emojis and other symbols. Especially when doing sentiment analysis emojis and other symbols carrying sentiments should not be deleted! What we can delete are symbols we have no embeddings for. So lets check the characters in our texts and find those to delete:

# In[15]:


jigsaw_chars = build_vocab(list(train["comment_text"]))
jigsaw_symbols = ''.join([c for c in jigsaw_chars if not c in white_list])

symbols_to_delete = ''.join([c for c in jigsaw_symbols if not c in glove_symbols])

# In[17]:


symbols_to_isolate = ''.join([c for c in jigsaw_symbols if c in glove_symbols])

# Next comes the next trick. Instead of using an inefficient loop of `replace` we use `translate`. I find the syntax a bit weird, but the improvement in speed is worth the worse readablity.
