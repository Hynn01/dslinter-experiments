# # INTRODUCTION
# * I want to share with you a situation that draws my attention about exploratory data analysis(EDA).
# * When I look at exploratory data analysis I observe that most of the plots or graphs are ordinary like bar plots, heat maps for correlation and maps.
# * Although I like reading different kernels and exploring varied datasets, same visualization plots are boring for me and they do not improve me.
# * On the other hand, in order to make better visualization, you need to improve and fill with more visualization technique your graphic repository. 
# * Therefore, I make tutorial about rare visualization techniques. Some of the plots or graphs can be familiar for you but as much as I can, I will try to visualize different graphics.
# * Python is open source and diffent libraries can be used. Lets look at which visualization libraries we will use.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib_venn as venn
from math import pi

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# ## Matrix and Bar Plots (Missingno)
# * In data analysis, one of the first steps is cleaning messy datasets and missing values.
# * In order to explore whether data has missign value or not, I always use .info() method from pandas library. It gives a lot of information.
# * Visualization is always attractive for people. Therefore, if we can visualize missign values, it can be better understandable.
# * In order to visualize missign data, we can use missigno package.
# * Lets create pandas dataframe that includes missign values (NaN) and visualize it.
#     * Dictionary: One of the methods of creating data frame is first creating dictionary then put it into pd.DataFrame
#     * data_missingno: Data frame that we will use in this example
#     * import missingno as msno: import missingno library and define as msno (shortcut)
#     * matrix(): Create matrix. Number of rows is number of sample and number of columns is number of features(column1, column2, column3) in data_missingno.
#     * show(): shows the plot
# * The sparkline at right summarizes the general shape of the data completeness and points out the maximum and minimum rows.
# * Missign values are white and non missign values are black in plot.
# * It can be seen from plot column1 does not have missign value. Column2 has five missign values and column3 has three missign values.

# Define dictionary
dictionary = {"column1":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20],
              "column2":[1,2,3,4,np.nan,6,7,8,np.nan,10,np.nan,12,13,14,15,16,np.nan,18,np.nan,20],
              "column3":[1,2,3,4,np.nan,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,np.nan,15,16,17,18,np.nan,20]}
# Create data frame from dictionary
data_missingno = pd.DataFrame(dictionary) 

# import missingno library
import missingno as msno
msno.matrix(data_missingno)
plt.show()


# In[ ]:





# * Apart from matrix plot we can use bar plot to observe missign values.
# * Bar is a simple visualization of nullity by column.
# * Numbers at left side of plot is percentage.
# * Numbers at top of the plot is number of non missign values
# * Numbers at right side of plot is number of sample in data.

# missingno bar plot
msno.bar(data_missingno)
plt.show()

# ## Parallel Plots (Pandas)
# * In order to learn parallel plots, we will use famous iris data set from sklearn library
# * Parallel plot allow to compare the feature of several individual observations on a set of numerical variables.
# * Each vertical bar represents a feature(column or variable) like petal length (cm).
# * Values are then plotted as series of lines connected across each axis.
# * Different colors shows different classes like setosa.
# * Parallel plot allow to detect interesting patterns. For example as you can see we can easily classify *setosa* according to *petal width (cm)* feature.
# * Lets look at code.
#     * Load iris data into data frame
#     * parallel_coordinates: we import parallel_coordinates from pandas library
#     * colormap: color map that paints classes with different colors

# In[ ]:


# load iris data
data = pd.read_csv('../input/Iris.csv')
data = data.drop(['Id'],axis=1)
# Make the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
parallel_coordinates(data, 'Species', colormap=plt.get_cmap("Set1"))
plt.title("Iris data class visualization according to features (setosa, versicolor, virginica)")
plt.xlabel("Features of data set")
plt.ylabel("cm")
plt.savefig('graph.png')
plt.show()


# <a id="3"></a> <br>
# ## Network Charts (Networkx)
# * We will use iris data that we import at previous part( parallel plot)
# * Network charts are related with correlation network.
# * It can be used instead of heatmaps in seaborn library.
# * At first look at correlation between features.
#     * corr(): gives correlation between features
#     * As you can see from table below, petal length is positively correlated with sepal length and petal width. Also, petal length is negatively correlated with sepal width.

# In[ ]:


# Calculate the correlation between individuals.
corr = data.iloc[:,0:4].corr()
corr


# * We have 4 individuals(features), and know how close they are related to each other (above correlation table).
# * It is possible to represent these relationships in a network
# * Each individual called as a node. If 2 individuals(features like sepal length and sepal width) are close enough (threshold), then they are linked by a line.
#     * threshold: threshold of the correlation. For example, if we say that threshold = 0.5, network will be established between the nodes that have higher correlation than 0.5
# * I will put -1 that is default threshold value. min(cor(A,B))= -1 so all nodes are connected with each other.
# * You can try threshold = 0.9, you will see that petal length and width are connected with each other.
# * It is alternative to heatmap.
# * As a final words of network charts, they can be used in data sets that are related with populations and their habits. Maybe,we can observe populations are clearly split in X groups according to their habits.
# * Now lets look at our code with iris datasets.

# In[ ]:


# import networkx library
import networkx as nx

# Transform it in a links data frame (3 columns only):
links = corr.stack().reset_index()
links.columns = ['var1', 'var2','value']

# correlation
threshold = -1

# Keep only correlation over a threshold and remove self correlation (cor(A,A)=1)
links_filtered=links.loc[ (links['value'] >= threshold ) & (links['var1'] != links['var2']) ]
 
# Build your graph
G=nx.from_pandas_dataframe(links_filtered, 'var1', 'var2')
 
# Plot the network
nx.draw_circular(G, with_labels=True, node_color='orange', node_size=300, edge_color='red', linewidths=1, font_size=10)

feature_size = [len(sepal_length),len(sepal_width),len(petal_length),len(petal_width)]
# create a circle for the center of plot
circle = plt.Circle((0,0),0.2,color = "white")
