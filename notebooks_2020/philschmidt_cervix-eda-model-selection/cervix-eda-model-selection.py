# # Cervix EDA
# 
# In this competition we have a multi-class classification problem with **three** classes. We are asked, given an image, to identify the cervix type.
# 
# From the data description:
# 
# *In this competition, you will develop algorithms to correctly classify cervix types based on cervical images. These different types of cervix in our data set are all considered normal (not cancerous), but since the transformation zones aren't always visible, some of the patients require further testing while some don't. This decision is very important for the healthcare provider and critical for the patient. Identifying the transformation zones is not an easy task for the healthcare providers, therefore, an algorithm-aided decision will significantly improve the quality and efficiency of cervical cancer screening for these patients.*
# 
# The submission format is asking for a probability for each of the three different cervix types.
# 
# In this notebook we will be looking at:
# 
# * basic dataset stats like number of samples per class, image sizes
# * different embeddings of RGB image space
# * pairwise distances and a clustermap of images in RGB space
# * (linear) model selection with basic multi class evaluation metrics.
# 
# **If you like this kernel, please give an upvote, thanks! :)**

# We will now take all of the sample images, rescale them & convert them to grayscale. This will result in a matrix, where each row are all flattened pixel for the grayscale images.
# 
# The original images have, as we have seen earlier, quite a high resolution, so scaling them down to **100 x 100** is resulting in a great loss of information, so the embedding to two dimensions is likely not going to have a good structure where we can separate visually by cervical cancer types. Also, we are giving only very few images per class that TSNE can work with to find a good, distance preserving, embedding.
# 
# I've added the option to choose to convert them to grayscale before passing them to TSNE. Per default each image will now keep its RGB information and therefore will be transformed to a 100*100*3 = 30.000 dimensional vector.

# ----------

# # Model Selection
# 
# Now that we've established a basic idea about the data, let's do the most straightforward approach, where we take the resized color images and labels and train a, most likely quite heavily regularized, linear model like logistic regression on it.
# 
# It is quite important to understand that we only have read a few training instances, 108, and have thousands of dimensions. To be able to cope with that we'll most likely end up using L1 regularization.
# 
# For the multi-class problem we are faced with here, we'll use standard approach of OVR (one vs rest), meaning we will train three models where each of them is designed to distinguish class 1, 2 and 3 from the others respectively.
