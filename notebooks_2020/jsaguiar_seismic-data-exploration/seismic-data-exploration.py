# <h2>1. Overview</h2>
# 
# As stated in the description, the data for this competition comes from a experimental set-up used to study earthquake physics. Our goal is to predict the time remaining before the next laboratory earthquake. The only feature we have is the seismic signal (acoustic data), which is recorded using a piezoceramic sensor and corresponds to the voltage upon deformation (in integers).
# 
# * Training data: single, continuous segment of experimental data.
# 
# * Test data: consists of a folder containing many small segments. The data within each test file is continuous, but the test files do not represent a continuous segment of the experiment.
# 
# * Both the training and the testing set come from the same experiment.
# 
# * There is no overlap between the training and testing sets.
# 
# There are a lot of files in this competition, so let's start with the folders structure:

# The time to failure (TTF) is linearly decreasing at a very slow rate. However, when looking at ten thousand rows it's possible to see some "jumps":

# In[17]:


single_timeseries(10000, title="Ten thousand rows")


# According to [this discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction/discussion/77526):
# 
# > The data is recorded in bins of 4096 samples. Within those bins seismic data is recorded at 4MHz, but there is a 12 microseconds (1e-6) gap between each bin, an artifact of the recording device.
# 
# Therefore, the "jumps" have 12 microseconds and occur every 4096 measurements. The next plot has ten million rows, but we are plotting only every 10 data points:

# In[20]:


single_timeseries(10000000, step=10, title="Ten million rows")


# We can't see the jumps anymore; it's as if we have stretched the line and the steps disappeared. There is only one huge change in TTF, which is exactly when an earthquake occured and the time goes from almost zero to eleven seconds.
# 
# Finally, let's plot all the data (629.145 million rows):

# In[21]:


single_timeseries(629145000, step=1000, title="All training data")


# There are 16 earthquakes in the training data. The shortest time to failure is 1.5 seconds for the first earthquake and 6s to the 7º, while the longest is around 16 seconds.
# 
# In the plot below I just changed the time_to_failure color to white. Now it's possible to see a peak in acoustic data before each earthquake:

# In[22]:


single_timeseries(629145000, step=1000, title="All training data", color2='white')


# This is not a perfect rule though: there are some peaks far from earthquakes (e.g. between the 14º and 15º). Another interesting thing to check is the time between these high levels of seismic signal and the earthquakes. I'm considering any acoustic data with **absolute value greater than 500 as a high level:**

# In[ ]:


peaks = train[train.acoustic_data.abs() > 500]
peaks.time_to_failure.describe()


# In[ ]:


plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.title("Cumulative distribution - time to failure with high signal")
ax = sns.distplot(peaks.time_to_failure, hist_kws=dict(cumulative=True), kde_kws=dict(cumulative=True))


# **More than 80% of high acoustic values are around 0.31 seconds before an earthquake!**

# <h3>2.4 Time between measurements</h3>
# 
# Let's have a closer look at the TTF difference between each measurament. I'm using a numba function to find each **unique** difference with a given threshold and ploting the values:

# In[31]:


unique_diff = get_diff(train.time_to_failure.values, threshold=1e-10)
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.title("Time to failure - unique differences")
ax = sns.scatterplot(x=range(len(unique_diff)), y=unique_diff, color='red')


# I'm not sure if the different values are due to numeric precision, but we can see two main ranges; the first around 0.001 and the other very close to zero. The former should be the 12 microseconds between each bin, but it's actually much higher (from 1.2e-5 to 1e-3).  

# <h2>3. Test data</h2>
# 
# Each file is a segment with 150,000 values for acoustic data (single column). The following distribution is for the first test file:

# In[32]:
