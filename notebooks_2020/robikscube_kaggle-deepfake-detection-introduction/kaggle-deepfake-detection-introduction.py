# # Can you detect the deepfake?
# ![](https://i.blogs.es/841847/jennifer_buscemi/450_1000.jpg)
# 
# Come here for a summary? Here is a tl;dr:
# - I strongly encourage you start first with the [official Getting Started guide here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview/getting-started).
# - What is the goal of the Deepfake Detection Challenge? According to the FAQ "The AI technologies that power deepfakes and other tampered media are rapidly evolving, making deepfakes so hard to detect that, at times, even human evaluators can’t reliably tell the difference. The Deepfake Detection Challenge is designed to incentivize rapid progress in this area by inviting participants to compete to create new ways of detecting and preventing manipulated media."
# - This is a Code Competition:
#     - CPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time, GPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time on Kaggle's P100 GPUs, No internet access enabled
#     - External data is **allowed up to 1 GB in size**. External data must be freely & publicly available, including pre-trained models
# - This code competition's **training set is not available directly on Kaggle**, as its size is prohibitively large to train in Kaggle. Instead, it's **strongly recommended that you train offline** and load the externally trained model as an external dataset into Kaggle Notebooks to perform inference on the Test Set. Review Getting Started for more detailed information.

# # Scoring
# Submissions are scored on log loss:
# $$ LogLoss = - \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n [y_i \cdot log_e(\hat{y_i}) + (1-y_i) \cdot log_e(1-\hat{y_i})]  $$
# where:
# - $n$ is the number of videos being predicted
# - $y^i$ is the predicted probability of the video being FAKE
# - $y_i$ is 1 if the video is FAKE, 0 if REAL
# - $log()$ is the natural (base e) logarithm
#

from sklearn.metrics import log_loss
log_loss(["REAL", "FAKE", "FAKE", "REAL"],
         [[.1, .9], [.9, .1], [.8, .2], [.35, .65]])


# ## Data
# - The data is comprised of .mp4 files, split into compressed sets of ~10GB apiece. A metadata.json accompanies each set of .mp4 files, and contains filename, label (REAL/FAKE), original and split columns, listed below under Columns.
# - The full training set is just over 470 GB.

# # Description of Datsets
# Per the competition description [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview/getting-started):
# 
# *There are 4 groups of datasets associated with this competition.*
# 
# **Training Set:** *This dataset, containing labels for the target, is available for download outside of Kaggle for competitors to build their models. It is broken up into 50 files, for ease of access and download. Due to its large size, it must be accessed through a GCS bucket which is only made available to participants after accepting the competition’s rules. Please read the rules fully before accessing the dataset, as they contain important details about the dataset’s permitted use. It is expected and encouraged that you train your models outside of Kaggle’s notebooks environment and submit to Kaggle by uploading the trained model as an external data source.*
# 
# **Public Validation Set:** *When you commit your Kaggle notebook, the submission file output that is generated will be based on the small set of 400 videos/ids contained within this Public Validation Set. This is available on the Kaggle Data page as test_videos.zip*
# 
# **Public Test Set:** *This dataset is completely withheld and is what Kaggle’s platform computes the public leaderboard against. When you “Submit to Competition” from the “Output” file of a committed notebook that contains the competition’s dataset, your code will be re-run in the background against this Public Test Set. When the re-run is complete, the score will be posted to the public leaderboard. If the re-run fails, you will see an error reflected in your “My Submissions” page. Unfortunately, we are unable to surface any details about your error, so as to prevent error-probing. You are limited to 2 submissions per day, including submissions which error.*
# 
# **Private Test Set:** *This dataset is privately held outside of Kaggle’s platform, and is used to compute the private leaderboard. It contains videos with a similar format and nature as the Training and Public Validation/Test Sets, but are real, organic videos with and without deepfakes. After the competition deadline, Kaggle transfers your 2 final selected submissions’ code to the host. They will re-run your code against this private dataset and return prediction submissions back to Kaggle for computing your final private leaderboard scores.*

# # Review of Data Files Accessable within kernel
# 
# ### Files
# - **train_sample_videos.zip** - a ZIP file containing a sample set of training videos and a metadata.json with labels. the full set of training videos is available through the links provided above.
# - **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format.
# - **test_videos.zip** - a zip file containing a small set of videos to be used as a public validation set.
# To understand the datasets available for this competition, review the Getting Started information.
# 
# ### Metadata Columns
# - **filename** - the filename of the video
# - **label** - whether the video is REAL or FAKE
# - **original** - in the case that a train set video is FAKE, the original video is listed here
# - **split** - this is always equal to "train".

# # Lets use the face_recognition package to detect faces in the video*
# Check out this great kernel here https://www.kaggle.com/brassmonkey381/a-quick-look-at-the-first-frame-of-each-video for how I learned to capture a frame from the video file.
# 
# * Note that in this kernel I use `pip` to install the `face_recognition` package. This is for demonstration purposes. In the final evaluation kernel you will not be able to have internet access. We can request that kaggle add this package to the official kernel docker image.
