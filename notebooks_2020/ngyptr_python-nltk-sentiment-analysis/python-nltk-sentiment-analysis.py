# **Sentiment Analysis:**
# the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

# I decided to only do sentiment analysis on this dataset, therfore I dropped the unnecessary colunns, keeping only *sentiment* and *text*.

# In[2]:


data = pd.read_csv('../input/Sentiment.csv')
# Keeping only the neccessary columns
data = data[['text','sentiment']]


# First of all, splitting the dataset into a training and a testing set. The test set is the 10% of the original dataset. For this particular analysis I dropped the neutral tweets, as my goal was to only differentiate positive and negative tweets.

# In[3]:


# Splitting the dataset into train and test set
train, test = train_test_split(data,test_size = 0.1)
# Removing neutral sentiments
train = train[train.sentiment != "Neutral"]


# As a next step I separated the Positive and Negative tweets of the training set in order to easily visualize their contained words.  After that I cleaned the text from hashtags, mentions  and links. Now they were ready for a WordCloud visualization which shows only the most emphatic words of the Positive and Negative tweets.

# Interesting to notice the following words and expressions in the positive word set:
#  **truth**, **strong**, **legitimate**,  **together**, **love**, **job**
# 
# In my interpretation, people tend to believe that their ideal candidate is truthful, legitimate, above good and bad.
# 
# 
# ----------
# 
# 
# At the same time, negative tweets contains words like:
# **influence**, **news**, **elevator music**, **disappointing**, **softball**, **makeup**, **cherry picking**, **trying**
# 
# In my understanding people missed the decisively acting and considered the scolded candidates too soft and cherry picking.

# After the vizualization, I removed the hashtags, mentions, links and stopwords from the training set.
# 
# **Stop Word:** Stop Words are words which do not contain important significance to be used in Search Queries. Usually these words are filtered out from search queries because they return vast amount of unnecessary information. ( the, for, this etc. )

# ## Epilog ##
# 
# In this project I was curious how well nltk and the NaiveBayes Machine Learning algorithm performs for Sentiment Analysis. In my experience, it works rather well for negative comments. The problems arise when the tweets are ironic, sarcastic has reference or own difficult context.
# 
# Consider the following tweet:
# *"Muhaha, how sad that the Liberals couldn't destroy Trump.  Marching forward."*
# As you may already thought, the words **sad** and **destroy** highly influences the evaluation, although this tweet should be positive when observing its meaning and context. 
# 
# To improve the evalutation accuracy, we need something to take the context and references into consideration. As my project 2.0, I will try to build an LSTM network, and benchmark its results compared to this nltk Machine Learning implementation. Stay tuned.
