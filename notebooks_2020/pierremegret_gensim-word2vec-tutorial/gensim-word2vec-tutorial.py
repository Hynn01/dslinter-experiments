# # Motivation
# 
# As I started working at [Supportiv](http://www.supportiv.com), the support network for instant peer support, a few months ago, I began looking into Language Models and Word2Vec particularly. A python native, I naturally decided to focus on Gensim's implementation of Word2Vec, and went on to look for tutorials on the web. As all good data scientists, I directly applied and reproduced the code samples from multiple website. Confused and often disappointed by the results I got, I went deeper and deeper, from stackoverflow threads, to Gensim's Google Groups, onto the documentation of the library, to try and understand what went wrong in my approach. After weeks of hard labor, I finally managed to get decent results, but I was frustrated by these online tutorials which were, for the most part, misleading.
# 
# What troubled me the most in these online tutorials was their mismanagement of the model training: the code worked, and I got results which appeared to be decent at first, but the more I looked into them, the more disturbing they were. I wasted a lot of time figuring out what was wrong.
# 
# Another issue I had with these tutorials was the data preparation step: too often, the authors chose to load an existing preprocessed dataset, use a toy example or skip this part. However, I always thought that one of the most important parts of the creation of a Word2Vec model was then missing. During my experimentations, I noticed that lemmatizing the sentences or looking for phrases/bigrams in them had a big impact over the results and performance of my models. Though the influence of the preprocessing varies with each dataset and application, I thought I would include the data preparation steps in this tutorial and use the great spaCy library along with it.
# 
# I am not the only one annoyed by some of these [issues](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gensim/jom4JFt7EV8/y5fjhupbAgAJ), so I decided to write my own tutorial.
# 
# I do not pledge that it is perfect, nor the best way to implement Word2Vec, simply that it is better than a good chunk of what is out there ðŸ˜‰

# 
# 
# ## Purpose of the tutorial:
# As I said before, this tutorial focuses on the right use of the Word2Vec package from the Gensim libray; therefore, I am not going to explain the concepts and ideas behind Word2Vec here. I am simply going to give a very brief explanation, and provide you with links to good, in depth tutorials.
# 
# ## Brief explanation:
# 
# Word2Vec was introduced in two [papers](#Material-for-more-in-depths-understanding:) between September and October 2013, by a team of researchers at Google. Along with the papers, the researchers published their implementation in C. The Python implementation was done soon after the 1st paper, by [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html). 
# 
# The underlying assumption of Word2Vec is that two words sharing similar contexts also share a similar meaning and consequently a similar vector representation from the model. For instance: "dog", "puppy" and "pup" are often used in similar situations, with similar surrounding words like "good", "fluffy" or "cute", and according to Word2Vec they will therefore share a similar vector representation.<br>
# 
# From this assumption, Word2Vec can be used to find out the relations between words in a dataset, compute the similarity between them, or use the vector representation of those words as input for other applications such as text classification or clustering.
#

# 
# ## The data:
# I chose to play with the script from the Simpsons, both because I love the Simpsons and because with more than 150k lines of dialogues, the dataset was substantial!
# 
# This dataset contains the characters, locations, episode details, and script lines for approximately 600 Simpsons episodes, dating back to 1989. It can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/ambarish/fun-in-text-mining-with-simpsons/data (~25MB)

# # Preprocessing
# 
# We keep only two columns:
# * `raw_character_text`: the character who speaks (can be useful when monitoring the preprocessing steps)
# * `spoken_words`: the raw text from the line of dialogue
# 
# We do not keep `normalized_text` because we want to do our own preprocessing.
# 
# You can find the resulting file here: https://www.kaggle.com/pierremegret/dialogue-lines-of-the-simpsons

# In[ ]:


df = pd.read_csv('../input/simpsons_dataset.csv')
df.shape


# In[ ]:


df.head()


# The missing values comes from the part of the script where something happens, but with no dialogue. For instance "(Springfield Elementary School: EXT. ELEMENTARY - SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON)"

# In[ ]:


df.isnull().sum()


# Removing the missing values:

# In[ ]:


df = df.dropna().reset_index(drop=True)
df.isnull().sum()


# ## Cleaning:
# We are lemmatizing and removing the stopwords and non-alphabetic characters for each line of dialogue.

# In[ ]:


nlp = spacy.load('en', disable=['ner', 'parser']) # disabling Named Entity Recognition for speed

def cleaning(doc):
    # Lemmatizes and removes stopwords
    # doc needs to be a spacy Doc object
    txt = [token.lemma_ for token in doc if not token.is_stop]
    # Word2Vec uses context words to learn the vector representation of a target word,
    # if a sentence is only one or two words long,
    # the benefit for the training is very small
    if len(txt) > 2:
        return ' '.join(txt)


# Removes non-alphabetic characters:

# In[ ]:


brief_cleaning = (re.sub("[^A-Za-z']+", ' ', str(row)).lower() for row in df['spoken_words'])


# Taking advantage of spaCy .pipe() attribute to speed-up the cleaning process:

# In[ ]:


t = time()

txt = [cleaning(doc) for doc in nlp.pipe(brief_cleaning, batch_size=5000, n_threads=-1)]

print('Time to clean up everything: {} mins'.format(round((time() - t) / 60, 2)))


# Put the results in a DataFrame to remove missing values and duplicates:

# In[ ]:


df_clean = pd.DataFrame({'clean': txt})
df_clean = df_clean.dropna().drop_duplicates()
df_clean.shape


# ## Bigrams:
# We are using Gensim Phrases package to automatically detect common phrases (bigrams) from a list of sentences.
# https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/phrases.html
# 
# The main reason we do this is to catch words like "mr_burns" or "bart_simpson" !

# In[ ]:


from gensim.models.phrases import Phrases, Phraser


# As `Phrases()` takes a list of list of words as input:

# In[ ]:


sent = [row.split() for row in df_clean['clean']]


# Creates the relevant phrases from the list of sentences:

# In[ ]:


phrases = Phrases(sent, min_count=30, progress_per=10000)


# The goal of Phraser() is to cut down memory consumption of Phrases(), by discarding model state not strictly needed for the bigram detection task:

# In[ ]:


bigram = Phraser(phrases)


# Transform the corpus based on the bigrams detected:

# In[ ]:


sentences = bigram[sent]


# ## Most Frequent Words:
# Mainly a sanity check of the effectiveness of the lemmatization, removal of stopwords, and addition of bigrams.

# In[ ]:


word_freq = defaultdict(int)
for sent in sentences:
    for i in sent:
        word_freq[i] += 1
len(word_freq)


# In[ ]:


sorted(word_freq, key=word_freq.get, reverse=True)[:10]


# # Training the model
# ## Gensim Word2Vec Implementation:
# We use Gensim implementation of word2vec: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html

# In[ ]:


import multiprocessing

from gensim.models import Word2Vec


# ## Why I seperate the training of the model in 3 steps:
# I prefer to separate the training in 3 distinctive steps for clarity and monitoring.
# 1. `Word2Vec()`: 
# >In this first step, I set up the parameters of the model one-by-one. <br>I do not supply the parameter `sentences`, and therefore leave the model uninitialized, purposefully.
# 2. `.build_vocab()`: 
# >Here it builds the vocabulary from a sequence of sentences and thus initialized the model. <br>With the loggings, I can follow the progress and even more important, the effect of `min_count` and `sample` on the word corpus. I noticed that these two parameters, and in particular `sample`, have a great influence over the performance of a model. Displaying both allows for a more accurate and an easier management of their influence.
# 3. `.train()`:
# >Finally, trains the model.<br>
# The loggings here are mainly useful for monitoring, making sure that no threads are executed instantaneously.

# In[ ]:


cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count() # Count the number of cores in a computer


# ## The parameters:
# 
# * `min_count` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>int</font> - Ignores all words with total absolute frequency lower than this - (2, 100)
# 
# 
# * `window` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>int</font> - The maximum distance between the current and predicted word within a sentence. E.g. `window` words on the left and `window` words on the left of our target - (2, 10)
# 
# 
# * `size` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>int</font> - Dimensionality of the feature vectors. - (50, 300)
# 
# 
# * `sample` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>float</font> - The threshold for configuring which higher-frequency words are randomly downsampled. Highly influencial.  - (0, 1e-5)
# 
# 
# * `alpha` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>float</font> - The initial learning rate - (0.01, 0.05)
# 
# 
# * `min_alpha` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>float</font> - Learning rate will linearly drop to `min_alpha` as training progresses. To set it: alpha - (min_alpha * epochs) ~ 0.00
# 
# 
# * `negative` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>int</font> - If > 0, negative sampling will be used, the int for negative specifies how many "noise words" should be drown. If set to 0, no negative sampling is used. - (5, 20)
# 
# 
# * `workers` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>int</font> - Use these many worker threads to train the model (=faster training with multicore machines)

# In[ ]:


w2v_model = Word2Vec(min_count=20,

                     workers=cores-1)


# ## Building the Vocabulary Table:
# Word2Vec requires us to build the vocabulary table (simply digesting all the words and filtering out the unique words, and doing some basic counts on them):

# In[ ]:


t = time()

w2v_model.build_vocab(sentences, progress_per=10000)

print('Time to build vocab: {} mins'.format(round((time() - t) / 60, 2)))


# ## Training of the model:
# _Parameters of the training:_
# * `total_examples` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>int</font> - Count of sentences;
# * `epochs` <font color='purple'>=</font> <font color='green'>int</font> - Number of iterations (epochs) over the corpus - [10, 20, 30]

# In[ ]:


t = time()

w2v_model.train(sentences, total_examples=w2v_model.corpus_count, epochs=30, report_delay=1)

print('Time to train the model: {} mins'.format(round((time() - t) / 60, 2)))


# As we do not plan to train the model any further, we are calling init_sims(), which will make the model much more memory-efficient:

# In[ ]:


w2v_model.init_sims(replace=True)


# # Exploring the model
# ## Most similar to:
# 
# Here, we will ask our model to find the word most similar to some of the most iconic characters of the Simpsons!

# 
# Let's see what we get for the show's main character:

# In[ ]:


w2v_model.wv.most_similar(positive=["homer"])


# _A small precision here:_<br>
# The dataset is the Simpsons' lines of dialogue; therefore, when we look at the most similar words from "homer" we do **not** necessary get his family members, personality traits, or even his most quotable words. No, we get what other characters (as Homer does not often refers to himself at the 3rd person) said along with "homer", such as how he feels or looks ("depressed"), where he is ("hammock"), or with whom ("marge").
# 
# Let's see what the bigram "homer_simpson" gives us by comparison:

# In[ ]:


w2v_model.wv.most_similar(positive=["homer_simpson"])

# Willie the groundskeeper for the last one:

# ## Similarities:
# Here, we will see how similar are two words to each other :

# In[ ]:


w2v_model.wv.similarity("moe_'s", 'tavern')


# Who could forget Moe's tavern? Not Barney.

w2v_model.wv.similarity('maggie', 'baby')


# Maggie is indeed the most renown baby in the Simpsons!

# In[ ]:


w2v_model.wv.similarity('bart', 'nelson')


# Bart and Nelson, though friends, are not that close, makes sense!
# 
# ## Odd-One-Out:
# 
# Here, we ask our model to give us the word that does not belong to the list!
# 
# Between Jimbo, Milhouse, and Kearney, who is the one who is not a bully?

# In[ ]:


w2v_model.wv.doesnt_match(['jimbo', 'milhouse', 'kearney'])


# Milhouse of course!

# 
# What if we compared the friendship between Nelson, Bart, and Milhouse?

# In[ ]:


w2v_model.wv.doesnt_match(["nelson", "bart", "milhouse"])


# Seems like Nelson is the odd one here!

# Finally, we are going to plot the most similar words to Mr. Burns ranked 1st to 10th versus the ones ranked 11th to 20th:
# 
# (PS: Mr. Burns became mr_burn after the preprocessing)

# In[ ]:


tsnescatterplot(w2v_model, "mr_burn", [t[0] for t in w2v_model.wv.most_similar(positive=["mr_burn"], topn=20)][10:])


# As we can see, and that is very nice, all the 20 words are forming one cluster around Mr. Burns.
