# # Detailed Data Cleaning/Visualization
# 
# *A blog post about the final end-to-end solution (21st place) is available [here](http://alanpryorjr.com), and the source code is [on my github](https://github.com/apryor6/Kaggle-Competition-Santander)*
# 
# *This is a Python version of a kernel I wrote in R for this dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/santander-product-recommendation/detailed-cleaning-visualization). There are some slight differences between how missing values are treated in Python and R, so the two kernels are not exactly the same, but I have tried to make them as similar as possible. This was done as a convenience to anybody who wanted to use my cleaned data as a starting point but prefers Python to R. It also is educational to compare how the same task can be accomplished in either language.*
# 
# The goal of this competition is to predict which new Santander products, if any, a customer will purchase in the following month. Here, I will do some data cleaning, adjust some features, and do some visualization to get a sense of what features might be important predictors. I won't be building a predictive model in this kernel, but I hope this gives you some insight/ideas and gets you excited to build your own model.
# 
# Let's get to it
# 
# ## First Glance
# Limit the number of rows read in to avoid memory crashes with the kernel
