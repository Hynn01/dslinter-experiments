# Hello Everyone!!
#     
# I hope everyone is doing well. I am little bit late in contribution to COVID19, But i will make sure this notebook will be worth to some extent. I am going to analyze COVID19 for India only in my first notebook, Later i will cover more!! Thank you for being here, Happy Reading !! :)

# ### COVID19:

# 
# 
# Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
# Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
# 
# 
# ### HOW IT SPREADS?
# The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
# You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.
# 
# ### To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
# 
# * Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
# 
# * Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
# 
# * Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
# 
# * Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
# 
# * Stay home if you feel unwell.
# 
# * If you have a fever, a cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance.
# 
# * Follow the directions of your local health authority.
# 
# **Avoiding unneeded visits to medical facilities allows healthcare systems to operate more effectively, therefore protecting you and others.**

# # Statistical Trend
# 
# We can see that trend is increasing, But let me check with statistical evidence. I will decompose the data in to trend , I am not going to check seasonality because we don't have enough data or neither i want CORONA to be seasonal :) Jokes apart due to lack of data i will not check seasonality .

# > We can see trend component is matching to our initial plots, Recovery rate is somewhat linear from april 15 while death rate is also increasing.

# # Statistical Test
# 
# I was talking little bit earlier that, there might be a chance that with the increase in number of cases, death and cure cases is also increasing let us check that with statistical evidence.

# > We can see that there is strong correlation between confirmed cases, death and recovery.  But i think there might be causality. Let us check!!

# # Granger Causality Tests
# 
# The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality'>Granger causality test</a> is a a hypothesis test to determine if one time series is useful in forecasting another. While it is fairly easy to measure correlations between series - when one goes up the other goes up, and vice versa - it's another thing to observe changes in one series correlated to changes in another after a consistent amount of time. This <em>may</em> indicate the presence of causality, that changes in the first series influenced the behavior of the second. However, it may also be that both series are affected by some third factor, just at different rates. Still, it can be useful if changes in one series can predict upcoming changes in another, whether there is causality or not. In this case we say that one series "Granger-causes" another.

# In[ ]:


grangercausalitytests(covid_india[['Confirmed','Deaths']],maxlag=4);


# > In both cases we can see that p value is less than 0.05, So we can say that there must be third factor which is causing that strong correlation!!

# ## Well, I will end this notebook here only!! I have not done any Forecasting in this notebook, My main aim was to do some EDA and Reporting. I will forecast in my second notebook where i will be using RNN and Advance Arima Technique (auto_arima or SARIMA).
