# # Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction
# 
# 
# Welcome to another Kaggle challenge! The objective of the Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction contest is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the poverty level of households using both individual and household characteristics. This "data science for good" project offers the opportunity to put our skills towards a task more beneficial to society than getting people to click on ads!
# 
# In this notebook, we will walk through a complete machine learning solution: first, get introduced to the problem, then perform a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset, work on feature engineering, try out multiple machine learning models, select a model, work to optimize the model, and finally, inspect the outputs of the model and draw conclusions. __While this notebook may not get us to the top of the leaderboard, it is meant to be used as a teaching tool to give you a solid foundation to build on for future machine learning projects. Kaggle projects can teach us a lot about machine learning, but several of the strategies used to get to the very top of the leaderboard are not best practices, so here we'll stick to building a very good - although not quite first place - machine learning solution. While Kaggle projects are competitions, I think they are best described as "a machine learning education" disguised as a contest!"
# 
# If you are looking to follow-up on this work, I have additional work including a [kernel on using Automated Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/featuretools-for-good) with [Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/#minute-quick-start) for this problem (with slightly higher leaderboard score). (If you enjoy my writing style and explanations, I write for [Towards Data Science](http://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/))
# 
# ## Problem and Data Explanation
# 
# The data for this competition is provided in two files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The training set has 9557 rows and 143 columns while the testing set has 23856 rows and 142 columns. Each row represents __one individual__ and each column is a __feature, either unique to the individual, or for the household of the individual__. The training set has one additional column, `Target`, which represents the poverty level on a 1-4 scale and is the label for the competition. A value of 1 is the most extreme poverty. 
# 
# This is a __supervised multi-class classification machine learning problem__:
# 
# * __Supervised__: provided with the labels for the training data
# * __Multi-class classification__: Labels are discrete values with 4 classes
# 
# ### Objective
# 
# The objective is to predict poverty on a __household level__. We are given data on the individual level with each individual having unique features but also information about their household. In order to create a dataset for the task, we'll have to perform some _aggregations of the individual data_ for each household. Moreover, we have to make a prediction for every individual in the test set, but _"ONLY the heads of household are used in scoring"_ which means we want to predict poverty on a household basis. 
# 
# __Important note: while all members of a household should have the same label in the training data, there are errors where individuals in the same household have different labels. In these cases, we are told to use the label for the head of each household, which can be identified by the rows where `parentesco1 == 1.0`.__ We will cover how to correct this in the notebook (for more info take a look at the [competition main discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/discussion/61403)).
# 
# The `Target` values represent poverty levels as follows:
# 
#     1 = extreme poverty 
#     2 = moderate poverty 
#     3 = vulnerable households 
#     4 = non vulnerable households
# 
# The explanations for all 143 columns can be found in the [competition documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data), but a few to note are below:
# 
# * __Id__: a unique identifier for each individual, this should not be a feature that we use! 
# * __idhogar__: a unique identifier for each household. This variable is not a feature, but will be used to group individuals by household as all individuals in a household will have the same identifier.
# * __parentesco1__: indicates if this person is the head of the household.
# * __Target__: the label, which should be equal for all members in a household
# 
# When we make a model, we'll train on a household basis with the label for each household _the poverty level of the head of household_. The raw data contains a mix of both household and individual characteristics and for the individual data, we will have to find a way to aggregate this for each household. Some of the individuals belong to a household with _no head of household_ which means that unfortunately we can't use this data for training. These issues with the data are completely typical of __real-world__ data and hence this problem is great preparation for the datasets you'll encounter in a data science job! 
# 
# ### Metric
# 
# Ultimately we want to build a machine learning model that can predict the integer poverty level of a household. Our predictions will be assessed by the __Macro F1 Score.__ You may be familiar with the [standard F1 score](http://blog.exsilio.com/all/accuracy-precision-recall-f1-score-interpretation-of-performance-measures/) for binary classification problems which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:
# 
# $$F_1 = \frac{2}{\tfrac{1}{\mathrm{recall}} + \tfrac{1}{\mathrm{precision}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\mathrm{precision} \cdot \mathrm{recall}}{\mathrm{precision} + \mathrm{recall}}$$
# 
# For mutli-class problems, we have to average the F1 scores for each class. The macro F1 score averages the F1 score for each class _without taking into account label imbalances_. 
# 
# $$\text{Macro F1} = \frac{\text{F1 Class 1} + \text{F1 Class 2} + \text{F1 Class 3} + \text{F1 Class 4}}{4}$$
# 
# In other words, the number of occurrences of each label does not figure into the calculation when using macro (while it does when using the "weighted" score). (For more information on the differences, look at the [Scikit-Learn Documention for F1 Score](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) or this [Stack Exchange question and answers](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/15989/42908). If we want to assess our performance, we can use the code:
# 
# ```
# from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
# f1_score(y_true, y_predicted, average = 'macro`)
# ```
# 
# For this problem, the labels are imbalanced, which makes it a little strange to use macro averaging for the evaluation metric, but that's a decision made by the organizers and not something we can change! In your own work, you want to be aware of label imbalances and choose a metric accordingly. 
# 
# ## Roadmap
# 
# The end objective is a machine learning model that can predict the poverty level of a household. However, before we get carried away with modeling, it's important to understand the problem and data. Also, we want to evaluate numerous models before choosing one as the "best" and after building a model, we want to investigate the predictions. Our roadmap is therefore as follows:
# 
# 1. Understand the problem (we're almost there already)
# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
# 3. Feature engineering to create a dataset for machine learning
# 4. Compare several baseline machine learning models
# 5. Try more complex machine learning models
# 6. Optimize the selected model
# 7. Investigate model predictions in context of problem
# 6. Draw conclusions and lay out next steps 
# 
# The steps laid out above are iterative meaning that while we will go through them one at a time, we might go back to an earlier step and revisit some of our decisions. In general, data science is a non-linear pracice where we are constantly evaluating our past decisions and making improvements. In particular, feature engineering, modeling, and optimization are steps that we often repeat because we never know if we got them right the first time!
# 
# # Getting Started
# 
# We have a pretty good grasp of the problem, so we'll move into the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering. For the EDA we'll examine any interesting anomalies, trends, correlations, or patterns that can be used for feature engineering and for modeling. We'll make sure to investigate our data both quantitatively (with statistics) and visually (with figures). 
# 
# Once we have a good grasp of the data and any potentially useful relationships, we can do some feature engineering (the most important part of the machine learning pipeline) and establish a baseline model. This won't get us to the top of the leaderboard, but it will provide a strong foundation to build on! 
# 
# With all that info in mind (don't worry if you haven't got all the details), let's get started! 

# #### Imports
# 
# We'll use a familiar stack of data science libraries: `Pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and eventually `sklearn` for modeling. 

# In[ ]:


# Data manipulation
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set a few plotting defaults
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 18
plt.rcParams['patch.edgecolor'] = 'k'


# ### Read in Data and Look at Summary Information

# In[ ]:


pd.options.display.max_columns = 150

# Read in data
train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')
train.head()


# That gives us a look at all of the columns which don't appear to be in any order. To get a quick overview of the data we use `df.info()`.

# In[ ]:


train.info()


# This tells us there are 130 integer columns, 8 float (numeric) columns, and 5 object columns. The integer columns probably represent Boolean variables (that take on either 0 or 1) or [ordinal variables](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/mks/statmistakes/ordinal.html) with discrete ordered values. The object columns might pose an issue because they cannot be fed directly into a machine learning model.
# 
# Let's glance at the test data which has many more rows (individuals) than the train. It does have one fewer column because there's no Target!

# In[ ]:


test.info()


# #### Integer Columns
# 
# Let's look at the distribution of unique values in the integer columns. For each column, we'll count the number of unique values and show the result in a bar plot.

# In[ ]:


train.select_dtypes(np.int64).nunique().value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar(color = 'blue', 
                                                                             figsize = (8, 6),
                                                                            edgecolor = 'k', linewidth = 2);
plt.xlabel('Number of Unique Values'); plt.ylabel('Count');
plt.title('Count of Unique Values in Integer Columns');


# The columns with only 2 unique values represent Booleans (0 or 1). In a lot of cases, this boolean information is already on a household level. For example, the `refrig` column says whether or not the household has a refrigerator. When it comes time to make features from the Boolean columns that are on the household level, we will _not need to aggregate_ these. However, the Boolean columns that are on the individual level will need to be aggregated. 
# 
# #### Float Columns
# 
# Another column type is floats which represent continuous variables. We can make a quick distribution plot to show the distribution of all float columns. We'll use an [`OrderedDict`](https://pymotw.com/2/collections/ordereddict.html) to map the poverty levels to colors because this keeps the keys and values in the same order as we specify (unlike a regular Python dictionary).
# 
# The following graphs shows the distributions of the `float` columns colored by the value of the `Target`. With these plots, we can see if there is a significant difference in the variable distribution depending on the household poverty level.

# In[ ]:


from collections import OrderedDict

plt.figure(figsize = (20, 16))
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

# Color mapping
colors = OrderedDict({1: 'red', 2: 'orange', 3: 'blue', 4: 'green'})
poverty_mapping = OrderedDict({1: 'extreme', 2: 'moderate', 3: 'vulnerable', 4: 'non vulnerable'})

# Iterate through the float columns
for i, col in enumerate(train.select_dtypes('float')):
    ax = plt.subplot(4, 2, i + 1)
    # Iterate through the poverty levels
    for poverty_level, color in colors.items():
        # Plot each poverty level as a separate line
        sns.kdeplot(train.loc[train['Target'] == poverty_level, col].dropna(), 
                    ax = ax, color = color, label = poverty_mapping[poverty_level])
        
    plt.title(f'{col.capitalize()} Distribution'); plt.xlabel(f'{col}'); plt.ylabel('Density')

plt.subplots_adjust(top = 2)


# Later on we'll calculate correlations between the variables and the `Target` to gauge the relationships between the features, but these plots can already give us a sense of which variables may be most "relevant" to a model. For example, the `meaneduc`, representing the average education of the adults in the household appears to be related to the poverty level: __a higher average adult education leads to higher values of the target which are less severe levels of poverty__. The theme of the importance of education is one we will come back to again and again in this notebook! 

# #### Object Columns
# 
# The last column type is `object` which we can view as follows.

# In[ ]:


train.select_dtypes('object').head()


# The `Id` and `idhogar` object types make sense because these are identifying variables. However, the other columns seem to be a mix of strings and numbers which we'll need to address before doing any machine learning. According to the documentation for these columns:
# 
# * `dependency`: Dependency rate, calculated = (number of members of the household younger than 19 or older than 64)/(number of member of household between 19 and 64)
# * `edjefe`: years of education of male head of household, based on the interaction of escolari (years of education), head of household and gender, yes=1 and no=0
# * `edjefa`: years of education of female head of household, based on the interaction of escolari (years of education), head of household and gender, yes=1 and no=0
# 
# These explanations clear up the issue. For these three variables, __"yes" = 1__ and __"no" = 0__. We can correct the variables using a mapping and convert to floats. 

# In[ ]:


mapping = {"yes": 1, "no": 0}

# Apply same operation to both train and test
for df in [train, test]:
    # Fill in the values with the correct mapping
    df['dependency'] = df['dependency'].replace(mapping).astype(np.float64)
    df['edjefa'] = df['edjefa'].replace(mapping).astype(np.float64)
    df['edjefe'] = df['edjefe'].replace(mapping).astype(np.float64)

train[['dependency', 'edjefa', 'edjefe']].describe()


# In[ ]:


plt.figure(figsize = (16, 12))

# Iterate through the float columns
for i, col in enumerate(['dependency', 'edjefa', 'edjefe']):
    ax = plt.subplot(3, 1, i + 1)
    # Iterate through the poverty levels
    for poverty_level, color in colors.items():
        # Plot each poverty level as a separate line
        sns.kdeplot(train.loc[train['Target'] == poverty_level, col].dropna(), 
                    ax = ax, color = color, label = poverty_mapping[poverty_level])
        
    plt.title(f'{col.capitalize()} Distribution'); plt.xlabel(f'{col}'); plt.ylabel('Density')

plt.subplots_adjust(top = 2)


# These variables are now correctly represented as numbers and can be fed into a machine learning model. 
# 
# To make operations like that above a little easier, we'll join together the training and testing dataframes. This is important once we start feature engineering because we want to apply the same operations to both dataframes so we end up with the same features. Later we can separate out the sets based on the `Target`.

# In[ ]:


# Add null Target column to test
test['Target'] = np.nan
data = train.append(test, ignore_index = True)


# ## Exploring Label Distribution
# 
# Next, we can get an idea of how imbalanced the problem is by looking at the distribution of labels. There are four possible integer levels, indicating four different levels of poverty. To look at the correct labels, we'll subset only to the columns where `parentesco1 == 1` because this is the head of household, the correct label for each household.
# 
# The bar plot below shows the distribution of training labels (since there are no testing labels).

# In[ ]:


# Heads of household
heads = data.loc[data['parentesco1'] == 1].copy()

# Labels for training
train_labels = data.loc[(data['Target'].notnull()) & (data['parentesco1'] == 1), ['Target', 'idhogar']]

# Value counts of target
label_counts = train_labels['Target'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Bar plot of occurrences of each label
label_counts.plot.bar(figsize = (8, 6), 
                      color = colors.values(),
                      edgecolor = 'k', linewidth = 2)

# Formatting
plt.xlabel('Poverty Level'); plt.ylabel('Count'); 
plt.xticks([x - 1 for x in poverty_mapping.keys()], 
           list(poverty_mapping.values()), rotation = 60)
plt.title('Poverty Level Breakdown');

label_counts


# We are dealing with an imbalanced class problem (which makes it intriguing why the contest organizers choose the _macro_ F1 score as the metric instead of _weighted_ F1!). There are many more households that classify as _non vulnerable_ than in any other category. The _extreme_ poverty class is the smallest (I guess this should make us optimistic!).
# 
# One problem with imbalanced classification problems is that the machine learning model can have a difficult time predicting the minority classes because it sees far less examples. Think about this in human terms: if we are classifiying poverty and we see far more cases of no poverty than extreme poverty, it will make it more difficult for us to identify the high poverty households because of less exposure. One potential method to address class imbalanceds is through oversampling  (which is covered in more advanced notebooks).

# ## Addressing Wrong Labels
# 
# As with any realistic dataset, the Costa Rican Poverty data has some issues. Typically, 80% of a data science project will be spent cleaning data and fixing anomalies/errors. These can be either human entry errors, measurement errors, or sometimes just extreme values that are correct but stand out. For this problem, some of the labels are not correct because _individuals in the same household have a different poverty level_. We're not told why this may be the case, but we are told to use the head of household as the true label. 
# 
# That information makes our job much easier, but in a real-world problem, we would have to figure out the reason _Why_ the labels are wrong and how to address the issue on our own. This section fixes the issue with the labels although it is not strictly necessary: I kept it in the notebook just to show how we may deal with this issue.
# 
# ### Identify Errors
# 
# First we need to find the errors before we can correct them. To find the households with different labels for  family members, we can group the data by the household and then check if there is only one unique value of the `Target`.

# In[ ]:


# Groupby the household and figure out the number of unique values
all_equal = train.groupby('idhogar')['Target'].apply(lambda x: x.nunique() == 1)

# Households where targets are not all equal
not_equal = all_equal[all_equal != True]
print('There are {} households where the family members do not all have the same target.'.format(len(not_equal)))


# Let's look at one example.

# In[ ]:


train[train['idhogar'] == not_equal.index[0]][['idhogar', 'parentesco1', 'Target']]


# The organizers tell us that the correct label is that for the head of household, where `parentesco1 == 1`. For this household, the correct label is __3__ for all members. We can correct this (as shown later) by reassigning all the individuals in this household the correct poverty level. In the real-world, you might have to make the tough decision of how to address the problem by yourself (or with the help of your team).

# ### Families without Heads of Household
# 
# We can correct all the label discrepancies by assigning the individuals in the same household the label of the head of household. But wait, you may ask: "What if there are households without a head of household? And what if the members of those households have differing values of the label?" 
# 
# Well, since you asked, let's investigate exactly that question! 

# In[ ]:


households_leader = train.groupby('idhogar')['parentesco1'].sum()

# Find households without a head
households_no_head = train.loc[train['idhogar'].isin(households_leader[households_leader == 0].index), :]

print('There are {} households without a head.'.format(households_no_head['idhogar'].nunique()))


# In[ ]:


# Find households without a head and where labels are different
households_no_head_equal = households_no_head.groupby('idhogar')['Target'].apply(lambda x: x.nunique() == 1)
print('{} Households with no head have different labels.'.format(sum(households_no_head_equal == False)))


# Well that's a relief! This means that we don't have to worry about a household both where there is no head __AND__ the members have different values of the label! For this problem, according to the organizers, __if a household does not have a head, then there is no true label. Therefore, we actually won't use any of the households without a head for training__ Nonetheless, it's still a good exercise to go through this process of investigating the data! 
# 
# ### Correct Errors
# 
# Now we can correct labels for the households that do have a head __AND__ the members have different poverty levels.

# In[ ]:


# Iterate through each household
for household in not_equal.index:
    # Find the correct label (for the head of household)
    true_target = int(train[(train['idhogar'] == household) & (train['parentesco1'] == 1.0)]['Target'])
    
    # Set the correct label for all members in the household
    train.loc[train['idhogar'] == household, 'Target'] = true_target
    
    
# Groupby the household and figure out the number of unique values
all_equal = train.groupby('idhogar')['Target'].apply(lambda x: x.nunique() == 1)

# Households where targets are not all equal
not_equal = all_equal[all_equal != True]
print('There are {} households where the family members do not all have the same target.'.format(len(not_equal)))


# Since we are only going to use the heads of household for the labels, __this step is not completely necessary but it shows a workflow for correcting data errors like you may encounter in real life__. Don't consider it extra work, just practice for your career! 

# ## Missing Variables
# 
# One of the most important steps of exploratory data analysis is finding missing values in the data and determining how to handle them. Missing values have to be filled in before we use a machine learning model and we need to think of the best strategy for filling them in based on the feature: this is where we'll have to start digging into the data definitions.
# 
# First we can look at the percentage of missing values in each column.

# In[ ]:


# Number of missing in each column
missing = pd.DataFrame(data.isnull().sum()).rename(columns = {0: 'total'})

# Create a percentage missing
missing['percent'] = missing['total'] / len(data)

missing.sort_values('percent', ascending = False).head(10).drop('Target')


# We don't have to worry about the `Target` becuase we made that `NaN` for the test data. However, we do need to address the other 3 columns with a high percentage of missing values.
# 
# __v18q1__: Number of tablets
# 
# Let's start with `v18q1` which indicates the number of tablets owned by a family. We can look at the value counts of this variable. Since this is a household variable, it only makes sense to look at it on a household level, so we'll only select the rows for the head of household.
# 
# #### Function to Plot Value Counts
# 
# Since we might want to plot value counts for different columns, we can write a simple function that will do it for us!

# In[ ]:


def plot_value_counts(df, col, heads_only = False):
    """Plot value counts of a column, optionally with only the heads of a household"""
    # Select heads of household
    if heads_only:
        df = df.loc[df['parentesco1'] == 1].copy()
        
    plt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))
    df[col].value_counts().sort_index().plot.bar(color = 'blue',
                                                 edgecolor = 'k',
                                                 linewidth = 2)
    plt.xlabel(f'{col}'); plt.title(f'{col} Value Counts'); plt.ylabel('Count')
    plt.show();


# In[ ]:


plot_value_counts(heads, 'v18q1')


# It looks like the most common number of tablets to own is 1 if we go only by the data that is present. However, we also need to think about the data that is missing. In this case, it could be that families with a `nan` in this category just do not own a tablet! If we look at the data definitions, we see that `v18q` indicates whether or not a family owns a tablet. We should investigate this column combined with the number of tablets to see if our hypothesis holds.
# 
# We can `groupby` the value of `v18q` (which is 1 for owns a tablet and 0 for does not) and then calculate the number of null values for `v18q1`. This will tell us if the null values represent that the family does not own a tablet.

# In[ ]:


heads.groupby('v18q')['v18q1'].apply(lambda x: x.isnull().sum())


# Well, that solves the issue! Every family that has `nan` for `v18q1` does not own a tablet. Therefore, we can fill in this missing value with zero.

# In[ ]:


data['v18q1'] = data['v18q1'].fillna(0)


# __v2a1__: Monthly rent payment
# 
# The next missing column is `v2a1` which represents the montly rent payment. 

# In addition to looking at the missing values of the monthly rent payment, it will be interesting to also look at the distribution of `tipovivi_`, the columns showing the ownership/renting status of the home. For this plot, we show the ownership status of those homes with a `nan` for the monthyl rent payment.

# In[ ]:


# Variables indicating home ownership
own_variables = [x for x in data if x.startswith('tipo')]


# Plot of the home ownership variables for home missing rent payments
data.loc[data['v2a1'].isnull(), own_variables].sum().plot.bar(figsize = (10, 8),
                                                                        color = 'green',
                                                              edgecolor = 'k', linewidth = 2);
plt.xticks([0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           ['Owns and Paid Off', 'Owns and Paying', 'Rented', 'Precarious', 'Other'],
          rotation = 60)
plt.title('Home Ownership Status for Households Missing Rent Payments', size = 18);


# The meaning of the home ownership variables is below:
# 
#     tipovivi1, =1 own and fully paid house
#     tipovivi2, "=1 own,  paying in installments"
#     tipovivi3, =1 rented
#     tipovivi4, =1 precarious
#     tipovivi5, "=1 other(assigned,  borrowed)"
#     
# We've solved the issue! Well, mostly: the households that do not have a monthly rent payment generally own their own home. In a few other situations, we are not sure of the reason for the missing information. 
# 
# For the houses that are owned and have a missing monthly rent payment, we can set the value of the rent payment to zero. For the other homes, we can leave the missing values to be imputed but we'll add a flag (Boolean) column indicating that these households had missing values.

# In[ ]:


# Fill in households that own the house with 0 rent payment
data.loc[(data['tipovivi1'] == 1), 'v2a1'] = 0

# Create missing rent payment column

data.loc[data['rez_esc'].notnull()]['age'].describe()

Anyone younger or older than this range presumably has no years behind and therefore the value should be set to 0. 
# For this variable, if the individual is over 19 and they have a missing value, or if they are younger than 7 and have a missing value we can set it to zero. For anyone else, we'll leave the value to be imputed and add a boolean flag.

# ## Plot Two Categorical Variables

# This looks like it could be an indicator of more poverty given the higher prevalence of 2: moderate poverty. 
# 
# __This represents an important point__: sometimes the missing information is just as important as the information you are given. 

# # Feature Engineering
# 
# There is plenty more exploratory data analysis we can do, but first we should work on consolidating our data at a household level. We already have some of the information for each household, but for training, we will need _all_ of the information summarized for each household. This means grouping the individuals in a house (`groupby`) and performing an aggregation (`agg`) of the individual variables. 
# 
# In another notebook, I show how we can use automated feature engineering to do this, and __automated feature engineering__ should be a standard part of the machine learning workflow. Right now, we'll stick to doing this by hand, but definitely take a look at __automated feature engineering in Featuretools__.

# ## Column Definitions
# 
# Sometimes in data science we have to get our hands dirty digging through the data or do tedious tasks that take a lot of time. This is that part of the analysis: we have to define the columns that are at an individual level and at a household level using the [data decsriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction/data). There is simply no other way to identify which variables at are the household level than to go through the variables themselves in the data description. Except, I've already done this for you, so all you have to do is copy and paste!
# 
# We'll define different variables because we need to treat some of them in a different manner. Once we have the variables defined on each level, we can work to start aggregating them as needed.
# 
# The process is as follows
# 
# 1. Break variables into household level and invididual level
# 2. Find suitable aggregations for the individual level data
#     * Ordinal variables can use statistical aggregations
#     * Boolean variables can also be aggregated but with fewer stats
# 3. Join the individual aggregations to the household level data
# 
# ### Define Variable Categories
# 
# There are several different categories of variables:
# 
# 1. Individual Variables: these are characteristics of each individual rather than the household
#     * Boolean: Yes or No (0 or 1)
#     * Ordered Discrete: Integers with an ordering
# 2. Household variables
#     * Boolean: Yes or No
#     * Ordered Discrete: Integers with an ordering
#     * Continuous numeric
# 3. Squared Variables: derived from squaring variables in the data
# 4. Id variables: identifies the data and should not be used as features
# 
# Below we manually define the variables in each category. This is a little tedious, but also necessary.

# #### Squared Variables
# 
# First, the easiest step: we'll remove all of the squared variables. Sometimes variables are squared or transformed as part of feature engineering because it can help linear models learn relationships that are non-linear. However, since we will be using more complex models, these squared features are redundant. They are highly correlated with the non-squared version, and hence can actually hurt our model by adding irrelevant information and also slowing down training.
# 
# For an example, let's take a look at `SQBage` vs `age`.

# In[ ]:


sns.lmplot('age', 'SQBage', data = data, fit_reg=False);
plt.title('Squared Age versus Age');


# These variables are highly correlated, and we don't need to keep both in our data.

# In[ ]:


# Remove squared variables
data = data.drop(columns = sqr_)
data.shape


# ## Id Variables
# 
# These are pretty simple: they will be kept as is in the data since we need them for identification.
# 
# ## Household Level Variables
# 
# First let's subset to the heads of household and then to the household level variables.

# In[ ]:


heads = data.loc[data['parentesco1'] == 1, :]
heads = heads[id_ + hh_bool + hh_cont + hh_ordered]
heads.shape


# For most of the household level variables, we can simply keep them as is: since we want to make predictions for each household, we use these variables as features. However, we can also remove some redundant variables and also add in some more features derived from existing data. 

# ### Redundant Household Variables
# 
# Let's take a look at the correlations between all of the household variables. If there are any that are too highly correlated, then we might want to remove one of the pair of highly correlated variables.
# 
# The following code identifies any variables with a greater than 0.95 absolute magnitude correlation.

# In[ ]:


# Create correlation matrix
corr_matrix = heads.corr()

# Select upper triangle of correlation matrix
upper = corr_matrix.where(np.triu(np.ones(corr_matrix.shape), k=1).astype(np.bool))

# Find index of feature columns with correlation greater than 0.95
to_drop = [column for column in upper.columns if any(abs(upper[column]) > 0.95)]

to_drop


# These show one out of each pair of correlated variables. To find the other pair, we can subset the `corr_matrix`. 

# In[ ]:


corr_matrix.loc[corr_matrix['tamhog'].abs() > 0.9, corr_matrix['tamhog'].abs() > 0.9]


# In[ ]:


sns.heatmap(corr_matrix.loc[corr_matrix['tamhog'].abs() > 0.9, corr_matrix['tamhog'].abs() > 0.9],
            annot=True, cmap = plt.cm.autumn_r, fmt='.3f');


# There are several variables here having to do with the size of the house:
# 
# * r4t3, Total persons in the household
# * tamhog, size of the household
# * tamviv, number of persons living in the household
# * hhsize, household size
# * hogar_total, # of total individuals in the household
# 
# These variables are all highly correlated with one another. In fact, `hhsize` has a perfect correlation with `tamhog` and `hogar_total`. We will remove these two variables because the information is redundant. We can also remove `r4t3` because it has a near perfect correlation with `hhsize`.
# 
# `tamviv` is not necessarily the same as `hhsize` because there might be family members that are not living in the household. Let's visualize this difference in a scatterplot.

# In[ ]:


heads = heads.drop(columns = ['tamhog', 'hogar_total', 'r4t3'])


# In[ ]:


sns.lmplot('tamviv', 'hhsize', data, fit_reg=False, size = 8);
plt.title('Household size vs number of persons living in the household');


# We see for a number of cases, there are more people living in the household than there are in the family. This gives us a good idea for a new feature: __the difference between these two measurements!__
# 
# Let's make this new feature.

# In[ ]:


heads['hhsize-diff'] = heads['tamviv'] - heads['hhsize']
plot_categoricals('hhsize-diff', 'Target', heads)


# Even though most households do not have a difference, there are a few that have more people living in the household than are members of the household.
# 
# Let's move on to the other redundant variables. First we can look at `coopele`

# In[ ]:


corr_matrix.loc[corr_matrix['coopele'].abs() > 0.9, corr_matrix['coopele'].abs() > 0.9]


# These variables indicate where the electricity in the home is coming from. There are four options, and the families that don't have one of these two options either have no electricity (`noelec`) or get it from a private plant (`planpri`). 
# 
# #### Creating Ordinal Variable
# 
# I'm going to compress these four variables into one by creating an ordinal variable. I'm going to choose the mapping myself, based on the data decriptions: 
# 
#     0: No electricity
#     1: Electricity from cooperative
#     2: Electricity from CNFL, ICA, ESPH/JASEC
#     3: Electricity from private plant
# 
# An ordered variable has an inherent ordering, and for this we choose our own based on the domain knowledge. After we create this new ordered variable, we can drop the four others. There are several households that do not have a variable here, so we will use a `nan` (which will be filled in during imputation) and add a Boolean column indicating there was no measure for this variable.

# In[ ]:


elec = []

# Assign values
for i, row in heads.iterrows():
    if row['noelec'] == 1:
        elec.append(0)
    elif row['coopele'] == 1:
        elec.append(1)
    elif row['public'] == 1:
        elec.append(2)
    elif row['planpri'] == 1:
        elec.append(3)
    else:
        elec.append(np.nan)
        
# Record the new variable and missing flag
heads['elec'] = elec
heads['elec-missing'] = heads['elec'].isnull()

# Remove the electricity columns
# heads = heads.drop(columns = ['noelec', 'coopele', 'public', 'planpri'])


# In[ ]:


plot_categoricals('elec', 'Target', heads)


# We can see that for every value of the Target, the most common source of electricity is from one of the listed providers. 

# The final redundant column is `area2`. This means the house is in a rural zone, but it's redundant because we have a column indicating if the house is in a urban zone. Therefore, we can drop this column.

# In[ ]:


heads = heads.drop(columns = 'area2')

heads.groupby('area1')['Target'].value_counts(normalize = True)


# It seems like households in an urban area (value of 1) are more likely to have lower poverty levels than households in a rural area (value of 0).

# ### Creating Ordinal Variables
# 
# For the walls, roof, and floor of the house, there are three columns each: the first indicating 'bad', the second 'regular', and the third 'good'. We could leave the variables as booleans, but to me it makes more sense to turn them into ordinal variables because there is an inherent order: `bad < regular < good`. To do this, we can simply find whichever column is non-zero for each household using `np.argmax`. 
# 
# Once we have created the ordinal variable, we are able to drop the original variables.

# In[ ]:


# Wall ordinal variable
heads['walls'] = np.argmax(np.array(heads[['epared1', 'epared2', 'epared3']]),
                           axis = 1)

# heads = heads.drop(columns = ['epared1', 'epared2', 'epared3'])
plot_categoricals('walls', 'Target', heads)


# In[ ]:


# Roof ordinal variable
heads['roof'] = np.argmax(np.array(heads[['etecho1', 'etecho2', 'etecho3']]),
                           axis = 1)
heads = heads.drop(columns = ['etecho1', 'etecho2', 'etecho3'])

# Floor ordinal variable
heads['floor'] = np.argmax(np.array(heads[['eviv1', 'eviv2', 'eviv3']]),
                           axis = 1)
# heads = heads.drop(columns = ['eviv1', 'eviv2', 'eviv3'])


# ## Feature Construction
# 
# In addition to mapping variables to ordinal features, we can also create entirely new features from the existing data, known as feature construction. For example, we can add up the previous three features we just created to get an overall measure of the quality of the house's structure.

# In[ ]:


# Create new feature
heads['walls+roof+floor'] = heads['walls'] + heads['roof'] + heads['floor']

plot_categoricals('walls+roof+floor', 'Target', heads, annotate=False)


# This new feature may be useful because it seems like a Target of 4 (the lowest poverty level) tends to have higher values of the 'house quality' variable. We can also look at this in a table to get the fine-grained details.

# In[ ]:


counts = pd.DataFrame(heads.groupby(['walls+roof+floor'])['Target'].value_counts(normalize = True)).rename(columns = {'Target': 'Normalized Count'}).reset_index()
counts.head()


# The next variable will be a `warning` about the quality of the house. It will be a negative value, with -1 point each for no toilet, electricity, floor, water service, and ceiling.

# In[ ]:


# No toilet, no electricity, no floor, no water service, no ceiling
heads['warning'] = 1 * (heads['sanitario1'] + 
                         (heads['elec'] == 0) + 
                         heads['pisonotiene'] + 
                         heads['abastaguano'] + 
                         (heads['cielorazo'] == 0))


# We can keep using our `plot_categoricals` function to visualize these relationships, but `seaborn` also has a number of plotting options that can work with categoricals. One is the `violinplot` which shows the distribution of a variable on the y axis with the width of each plot showing the number of observations in that category. 

# In[ ]:


plt.figure(figsize = (10, 6))
sns.violinplot(x = 'warning', y = 'Target', data = heads);
plt.title('Target vs Warning Variable');


# In[ ]:


plot_categoricals('warning', 'Target', data = heads)


# The violinplot is not great here because it smooths out the categorical variable with the effect that it looks as if the Target can take on lesser and greater values than in reality. Nonetheless, we can see a high concentration of households that have no warning signs and have the lowest level of poverty. It looks as if this may be a useful feature, but we can't know for sure until we get to modeling!

# The final household feature we can make for now is a `bonus` where a family gets a point for having a refrigerator, computer, tablet, or television.

# In[ ]:


# Owns a refrigerator, computer, tablet, and television
heads['bonus'] = 1 * (heads['refrig'] + 
                      heads['computer'] + 
                      (heads['v18q1'] > 0) + 
                      heads['television'])

sns.violinplot('bonus', 'Target', data = heads,
                figsize = (10, 6));
plt.title('Target vs Bonus Variable');


# ## Per Capita Features
# 
# Additional features we can make calculate the number of certain measurements for each person in the household.

# In[ ]:


heads['phones-per-capita'] = heads['qmobilephone'] / heads['tamviv']
heads['tablets-per-capita'] = heads['v18q1'] / heads['tamviv']
heads['rooms-per-capita'] = heads['rooms'] / heads['tamviv']
heads['rent-per-capita'] = heads['v2a1'] / heads['tamviv']


# ## Exploring Household Variables
# 
# After going to all the trouble of getting our features in order, now we can take a look at them in relation to the Target. We've already done a little of this, but now we can try to quantify relationships.
# 
# ### Measuring Relationships
# 
# There are many ways for measuring relationships between two variables. Here we will examine two of these:
# 
# 1. The Pearson Correlation: from -1 to 1 measuring the linear relationship between two variables
# 2. The Spearman Correlation: from -1 to 1 measuring the monotonic relationship between two variables
# 
# The Spearman correlation is 1 if as one variable increases, the other does as well, even if the relationship is not linear. On the other hand, the Pearson correlation can only be one if the increase is exactly linear. These are best illustrated by example.

# For the negative correlations, as we increase the variable, the Target decreases indicating the poverty severity increases. Therefore, as the `warning` increases, the poverty level also increases which makes sense because this was meant to show potential bad signs about a house. The `hogar_nin` is the number of children 0 - 19 in the family which also makes sense: younger children can be financial source of stress on a family leading to higher levels of poverty. Or, families with lower socioeconomic status have more children in the hopes that one of them will be able to succeed. Whatever the explanation, there is a [real link between family size and poverty](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/157217/adbi-rp68.pdf)
# 
# On the other hand, for the positive correlations, a higher value means a higher value of Target indicating the poverty severity decreases. The most highly correlated household level variable is `meaneduc`, the average education level of the adults in the household. This relationship between education and poverty intuitively makes sense: [greater levels of education generally correlate with lower levels of poverty](https://www.childfund.org/poverty-and-education/). We don't necessarily know which causes which, but we do know these tend to move in the same direction.
# 
# The general guidelines for correlation values are below, but these will change depending on who you ask ([source](http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/pearsons.pdf) for these):
# 
# *  .00-.19 “very weak”
# *  .20-.39 “weak”
# *  .40-.59 “moderate”
# *  .60-.79 “strong”
# *  .80-1.0 “very strong”
# 
# What these correlations show is that there are some weak relationships that hopefully our model will be able to use to learn a mapping from the features to the Target.
# 
# Now we can move on to the Spearman correlation.

# # Individual Level Variables

# There are two types of individual level variables: Boolean (1 or 0 for True or False) and ordinal (discrete values with a meaningful ordering). 

# In[ ]:


ind = data[id_ + ind_bool + ind_ordered]
ind.shape


# ## Redundant Individual Variables
# 
# We can do the same process we did with the household level variables to identify any redundant individual variables. We'll focus on any variables that have an absolute magnitude of the correlation coefficient greater than 0.95.

# In[ ]:


# Create correlation matrix
corr_matrix = ind.corr()

# Select upper triangle of correlation matrix
upper = corr_matrix.where(np.triu(np.ones(corr_matrix.shape), k=1).astype(np.bool))

# This is simply the opposite of male! We can remove the male flag.

# In[ ]:

# ### Creating Ordinal Variables
# 
# Much as we did with the household level data, we can map existing columns to an ordinal variable. Here we will focus on the `instlevel_` variables which indicate the amount of education an individual has from `instlevel1`: no level of education to `instlevel9`: postgraduate education. 
# 
# To create the ordinal variable, for each individual, we will simply find which column is non-zero. The education has an inherent ordering (higher is better) so this conversion to an ordinal variable makes sense in the problem context.

# ### Feature Construction
# 
# We can make a few features using the existing data. For example, we can divide the years of schooling by the age.

# In[ ]:


ind['escolari/age'] = ind['escolari'] / ind['age']

plt.figure(figsize = (10, 8))

ind['tech'] = ind['v18q'] + ind['mobilephone']
ind['tech'].describe()


# ## Feature Engineering through Aggregations
# 
# In order to incorporate the individual data into the household data, we need to aggregate it for each household. The simplest way to do this is to `groupby` the family id `idhogar` and then `agg` the data. For the aggregations for ordered or continuous variables, we can use six, five of which are built in to pandas, and one of which we define ourselves `range_`. The boolean aggregations can be the same, but this will create many redundant columns which we will then need to drop. For this case, we'll use the same aggregations and then go back and drop the redundant columns.

# In[ ]:


# Define custom function
range_ = lambda x: x.max() - x.min()
range_.__name__ = 'range_'

# Group and aggregate
ind_agg = ind.drop(columns = 'Target').groupby('idhogar').agg(['min', 'max', 'sum', 'count', 'std', range_])
ind_agg.head()


# With just that one line, we go from 30 features to 180. Next we can rename the columns to make it easier to keep track.

# In[ ]:


# Rename the columns

for c in ind_agg.columns.levels[0]:
    for stat in ind_agg.columns.levels[1]:
        new_col.append(f'{c}-{stat}')
        
ind_agg.columns = new_col
ind_agg.head()


# In[ ]:


ind_agg.iloc[:, [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]].head()


# ### Feature Selection 
# 
# As a first round of feature selection, we can remove one out of every pair of variables with a correlation greater than 0.95. 

# In[ ]:


# Create correlation matrix
corr_matrix = ind_agg.corr()

# Select upper triangle of correlation matrix

# In[ ]:


final.groupby('female-head')['meaneduc'].agg(['mean', 'count'])


# Overall, the average education of households with female heads is slightly higher than those with male heads. I'm not too sure what to make of this, but it seems right to me.

# # Machine Learning Modeling
# 
# Once feature engineering/construction is done, we can get started with the machine learning! All of our data (both training and testing) is aggregated for each household and so can be directly used in a model. To first show the process of modeling, we'll use the capable Random Forest Classifier in Scikit-Learn. This probably won't get us to the top of the leaderboard, but it will allow us to establish a baseline. Later we'll try several other models including the powerful Gradient Boosting Machine.
# 
# To assess our model, we'll use 10-fold cross validation on the training data. This will essentially _train and test the model 10 times_ using different splits of the training data. 10-fold cross validation is an effective method for estimating the performance of a model on the test set. We want to look at the average performance in cross validation as well as the standard deviation to see how much scores change between the folds. We use the `F1 Macro` measure to evaluate performance.

test_set = final[final['Target'].isnull()].drop(columns = ['Id', 'idhogar', 'Target'])

# Submission base which is used for making submissions to the competition
submission_base = test[['Id', 'idhogar']].copy()


# Because we are going to be comparing different models, we want to scale the features (limit the range of each column to between 0 and 1). For many ensemble models this is not necessary, but when we use models that depend on a distance metric, such as KNearest Neighbors or the Support Vector Machine, feature scaling is an absolute necessity. When comparing different models, it's always safest to scale the features. We also impute the missing values with the median of the feature.
# 
# For imputing missing values and scaling the features in one step, we can make a pipeline. This will be fit on the training data and used to transform the training and testing data.

# In[ ]:

train_set = pipeline.fit_transform(train_set)
test_set = pipeline.transform(test_set)


# The data has no missing values and is scaled between zero and one. This means it can be directly used in any Scikit-Learn model. 

# In[ ]:


model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=10,

# That score is not great, but it will serve as a baseline and leaves us plenty of room to improve! 

# ## Feature Importances
# 
# With a tree-based model, we can look at the feature importances which show a relative ranking of the usefulness of features in the model. These represent the sum of the reduction in impurity at nodes that used the variable for splitting, but we don't have to pay much attention to the absolute value. Instead we'll focus on relative scores.
# 
# If we want to view the feature importances, we'll have to train a model on the whole training set. Cross validation does not return the feature importances.

# Now that we have a good set of features, it's time to get into the modeling. We already tried one basic model, the Random Forest Classifier which delivered a best macro F1 of 0.35. However, in machine learning, there is no way to know ahead of time which model will work best for a given dataset. The following plot shows that __there are some problems where even Gaussian Naive Bayes will outperform a gradient boosting machine__.

# 
# ![algorithm_comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/algorithm_comparison.png)

# What this plot tells us is that we have to try out a number of different models to see which is optimal. Most people eventually settle on the __gradient boosting machine__ and we will try that out, but for now we'll take a look at some of the other options.  There are literally dozens (maybe hundreds) of multi-class machine learning models if we look at the [Scikit-Learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html). We don't have to try them all, but we should sample from the options.
# 
# What we want to do is write a function that can evaluate a model. This will be pretty simple since we already wrote most of the code. In addition to the Random Forest Classifier, we'll try eight other Scikit-Learn models. Luckily, this dataset is relatively small and we can rapidly iterate through the models. We will make a dataframe to hold the results and the function will add a row to the dataframe for each model.

# The most likely candidate seems to be the Random Forest because it does best right out of the box.  While we didn't tune any of the hyperparameters so the comparison between models is not perfect, these results reflect those of many other Kaggle competitiors finding that tree-based ensemble methods (including the Gradient Boosting Machine) perform very well on structured datasets. Hyperparameter performance does improve the performance of machine learning models, but we don't have time to try all possible combinations of settings for all models. The graph below ([from the paper by Randal Olson](https://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb18/olson.pdf)) shows the effect of hyperparameter tuning versus the default values in Scikit-Learn.
# 
# ![hyperparameter_improvement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/hyperparameter_improvement.png)
# 
# In most cases the accuracy gain is less than 10% so the worst model is probably not suddenly going to become the best model through tuning. 

# For now we'll say the random forest does the best. Later we'll look at using the Gradient Boosting Machine, although not implemented in Scikit-Learn. Instead we'll be using the more powerful [LightGBM version](http://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Now, let's turn to making a submission using the random forest.

# # Making a Submission
# 
# In order to make a submission, we need the test data. Fortunately, we have the test data formatted in exactly the same manner as the train data. 
# 
# The format of a testing submission is shown below. Although we are making predictions for each household, we actually need one row per individual (identified by the `Id`) but only the prediction for the head of household is scored. 
# 
# ```
# Id,Target
# ID_2f6873615,1
# ID_1c78846d2,2
# ID_e5442cf6a,3
# ID_a8db26a79,4
# ID_a62966799,4 
# ```
# 

# The `submission_base` will have all the individuals in the test set since we have to have a "prediction" for each individual while the `test_ids` will only contain the `idhogar` from the heads of households. When predicting, we only predict for each household and then we merge the `predictions` dataframe with all of the individuals on the household id (`idhogar`). This will set the `Target` to the same value for everyone in a household. For the test households without a head of household, we can just set these predictions to 4 since they will not be scored. 

# In[ ]:


test_ids = list(final.loc[final['Target'].isnull(), 'idhogar'])


# The function below takes in a model, a training set, the training labels, and a testing set and performs the following operations:
# 
# * Trains the model on the training data using `fit`
# * Makes predictions on the test data using `predict`
# * Creates a `submission` dataframe that can be saved and uploaded to the competition

# In[ ]:


def submit(model, train, train_labels, test, test_ids):
    """Train and test a model on the dataset"""
    
    # Train on the data
    model.fit(train, train_labels)
    predictions = model.predict(test)
    predictions = pd.DataFrame({'idhogar': test_ids,
                               'Target': predictions})

     # Make a submission dataframe
    submission = submission_base.merge(predictions, 
                                       on = 'idhogar',
                                       how = 'left').drop(columns = ['idhogar'])
    
    # Fill in households missing a head

                         train_set, train_labels, test_set, test_ids)

rf_submission.to_csv('rf_submission.csv', index = False)


# These predictions score __0.370__ when submitted to the competition.

# # Feature Selection
# 
# One potential method for improving model performance is feature selection. This is the process where we try to keep only the most useful features for our model. "Most useful" can mean many different things, and there are numerous heuristics for selecting the most important features. For feature selection in this notebook, we'll first remove any columns with greater than 0.95 correlation (we already did some of this during feature engineering) and then we'll apply recursive feature elimination with the Scikit-Learn library. 
# 
# First up are the correlations. 0.95 is an arbitrary threshold - feel free to change the values and see how the performance changes! 

# In[ ]:


train_set = pd.DataFrame(train_set, columns = features)

# Create correlation matrix
corr_matrix = train_set.corr()

# Select upper triangle of correlation matrix
upper = corr_matrix.where(np.triu(np.ones(corr_matrix.shape), k=1).astype(np.bool))

# Find index of feature columns with correlation greater than 0.95
to_drop = [column for column in upper.columns if any(abs(upper[column]) > 0.95)]

to_drop


# In[ ]:


train_set = train_set.drop(columns = to_drop)
train_set.shape


# In[ ]:


test_set = pd.DataFrame(test_set, columns = features)
train_set, test_set = train_set.align(test_set, axis = 1, join = 'inner')
features = list(train_set.columns)


# ### Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest
# 
# The `RFECV` in Sklearn stands for Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross Validation. The selector operates using a model with feature importances in an iterative manner. At each iteration, it removes either a fraction of features or a set number of features. The iterations continue until the cross validation score no longer improves. 
# 
# To create the `selector` object, we pass in the the model, the number of features to remove at each iteration, the cross validation folds, our custom scorer, and any other parameters to guide the selection.

# In[ ]:


from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV

# Create a model for feature selection
estimator = RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 10, n_estimators = 100,  n_jobs = -1)

# Create the object
selector = RFECV(estimator, step = 1, cv = 3, scoring= scorer, n_jobs = -1)


# Then we `fit` the selector on the training data as with any other sklearn model. This will continue the feature selection until the cross validation scores no longer improve. 

# In[ ]:


selector.fit(train_set, train_labels)


# We can investigate the object to see the training scores for each iteration. The following code will plot the validation scores versus the number of features for the training.

# In[ ]:


plt.plot(selector.grid_scores_);

plt.xlabel('Number of Features'); plt.ylabel('Macro F1 Score'); plt.title('Feature Selection Scores');
selector.n_features_


# We can see that the score improves as we add features up until 96 features. According to the selector, this is the optimal number of features.
# 
# The rankings of each feature can be found by inspecting the trained object. These represent essentially the importance of features averaged over the iterations. Features can share the same ranking, and only features with a rank of 1 are retained.

# In[ ]:


rankings = pd.DataFrame({'feature': list(train_set.columns), 'rank': list(selector.ranking_)}).sort_values('rank')
rankings.head(10)


# Finally, we select the features and then evaluate in cross validation.

# In[ ]:


train_selected = selector.transform(train_set)
test_selected = selector.transform(test_set)


# In[ ]:


# Convert back to dataframe
selected_features = train_set.columns[np.where(selector.ranking_==1)]
train_selected = pd.DataFrame(train_selected, columns = selected_features)
test_selected = pd.DataFrame(test_selected, columns = selected_features)

model_results = cv_model(train_selected, train_labels, model, 'RF-SEL', model_results)

# The model with selected features does slightly better in cross-validation. We can keep both sets of features for use in our next model, the Gradient Boosting Machine.

# # Upgrading Our Model: Gradient Boosting Machine
# 
# After using the Random Forest and getting decent scores, it's time to step up and use the gradient boosting machine. If you spend any time on Kaggle, you'll notice that the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) wins a high percentage of competitions where the data is structured (in tables) and the datasets are not that large (less than a million observations). 
# 
# I won't go too much into the details here, but instead will focus on the implementation. We'll use the GBM in LightGBM, although there are also options in Scikit-Learn, XGBOOST, and CatBoost. The first set of hyperparameters we'll use were based on those I've found have worked well for other problems.
# 
# ### Choosing Number of Estimators with Early Stopping
# 
# To choose the number of estimators (the number of decision trees in the ensemble, called `n_estimators` or `num_boost_rounds`), we'll use early stopping with 5-fold cross validation. This will keep adding estimators until the performance as measured by the Macro F1 Score has not increased for 100 training rounds. To use this metric, we'll have to define a custom metric.

# In[ ]:


def macro_f1_score(labels, predictions):
    # Reshape the predictions as needed
    predictions = predictions.reshape(len(np.unique(labels)), -1 ).argmax(axis = 0)
    
    metric_value = f1_score(labels, predictions, average = 'macro')
    
    # Return is name, value, is_higher_better
    return 'macro_f1', metric_value, True


# # Light Gradient Boosting Machine Implementation
# 
# The function below implements training the gradient boosting machine with Stratified Kfold cross validation and early stopping to prevent overfitting to the training data (although this can still occur). The function performs training with cross validation and records the predictions in probability for each fold. To see how this works, we can return the predictions from each fold and then we'll return a submission to upload to the competition.
# 
# Choosing hyperparameters for the Gradient Boosting Machine can be tough and generally is done through model optimization. In this notebook, we'll use a set of hyperparameters that I've found work well on previous problems (although they will not necessarily translate to this competition). 
# 
# We set the `n_estimators` to 10000 but we won't actually reach this number because we are using early stopping which will quit training estimators when the cross validation metric does not improve for `early_stopping_rounds`. There's a lot going on in this function, and read through it carefully to make sure you have it all! I've tried to make the comments and code straightforward. (The `display` is used to show custom information during training in combination with `%%capture` so we don't have to see all the LightGBM information during training).

# ### Cross Validation with Early Stopping Notes
# 
# Cross validation with early stopping is one of the most effective methods for preventing overfitting on the training set because it prevents us from continuing to add model complexity once it is clear that validation scores are not improving. Repeating this process across multiple folds helps to reduce the bias that comes from using a single fold. Early stopping also lets us train the model much quicker. Overall, __early stopping with cross validation__ is the best method to select the number of estimators in the Gradient Boosting Machine and should be our default technique when we desig an implementation.

# For each fold, the `1, 2, 3, 4` columns represent the probability for each `Target`. The `Target` is the maximum of these with the `confidence` the probability. We have the predictions for all 5 folds, so we can plot the confidence in each `Target` for the different folds.

# Overall, these results show the issue with imbalanced class problems: our model cannot distinguish very well between the classes that are underrepresented. Later we'll look at predictions themselves and see where our model is "confused". For now, we can generate a submission file and submit it to the competition.
# 
# When we actually make predictions for each household, we average the predictions from each of the folds. Therefore, we are essentially using multiple models since each one is trained on a slightly different fold of the data. The gradient boosting machine is already an ensemble machine learning model, and now we are using it almost as a meta-ensemble by averaging predictions from several gbms. 
# 
# This process is shown in the code below.

# Average the predictions over folds
predictions = predictions.groupby('idhogar', as_index = False).mean()

# Find the class and associated probability

# The next step to take is Model Optimization, the process of getting the most from a machine learning model. 

# # Model Optimization
# 
# Model optimization is the process of extracting the best performance from a machine learning model by tuning the hyperparameters through cross-validation. This is necessary because the best model hyperparameters are different for every dataset. 
# 
# In this notebook, we won't get too far into model tuning, but there are multiple options:
# 
# 1. Manual
# 2. Grid Search
# 3. Random Search
# 4. Automated Optimization
# 
# We will stick to 4. because it is generally the most efficient method and can easily be implemented in a number of libraries, including Hyperopt, which uses a modified version of Bayesian Optimization with the Tree Parzen Estimator. 

# # Model Tuning with Hyperopt
# 
# Bayesian optimization requires 4 parts:
# 
# 1. Objective function: what we want to maximize (or minimize)
# 2. Domain space: region over which to search 
# 3. Algorithm for choosing next hyperparameters: uses past results to suggest next values
# 4. Results history: saves the past results
# 
# I've written previously about using Hyperopt, so here we'll stick to the implementation.

# At this point, to improve our performance, we can continue with the optimization, try more feature engineering, stack or ensemble additional models, or look at more experimental methods such as dimension reduction or oversampling. However, the scores we are getting are fairly good and I'm going to move on to a crucial part of machine learning: investigating the predictions to see where our model is wrong. 
# 
# While Kaggle is great for presenting realistic datasets, the methods needed to get to the very top of the leaderboard are not generally used in the real-world. Past some level of performance, accuracy takes a back seat to interpretability. People want to know why a model makes the predictions it does, much as they would want a human to be able to explain her decisions. We could work on squeezing some more performance from our model, but right now, our energy is better spent investigating our model.

# ## Validation
# 
# For the test predictions, we can only compare the distribution with that found on the training data. If we want to compare predictions to actual answers, we'll have to split the training data into a separate validation set. We'll use 1000 examples for testing and then we can do operations like make the confusion matrix because we have the right answer.

# Here's how to read the confusion matrix: any of the values on the diagonal, the model got correct because the predicted value matches the true value. Anything not on the diagonal our model got wrong which we can assess by looking at the predicted value versus the actual value. 
# 
# For example, our model correctly predicted 25 observations where the poverty was extreme. On the other hand, for 26 cases where the poverty was extreme, our model predicted it was moderate. For 95 cases where the poverty was Non-Vulnerable, our model predicted the poverty was Vulnerable. Overall, we see that our model is only very accurate at idenifying the non-vulnerable households.
# 
# To look at the percentage of each true label predicted in each class, we can normalize the confusion matrix for the true labels.

# Now we can see that our model really does not do that well for classes other than Non Vulnerable. It only correctly identifies 15% of the Vulnerable households, classifying more of them as moderate or non vulnerable. Overall, these results show that imbalanced classification problems with relatively few observations are very difficult. There are some methods we can take to try and counter this such as oversampling or training multiple models on different sections of the data, but at the end of the day, the most effective method may be to __gather more data__. 

# # Dimension Reduction
# 
# As a final exploration of the problem, we can apply a few different dimension reductions methods to the selected data set. These methods can be used for visualization or as a preprocessing method for machine learning. We'll look at four different methods:
# 
# 1. [PCA: Principal Components Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). Finds the dimensions of greatest variation in the data
# 2. [ICA: Independent Components Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis). Attempts to separate a mutltivariate signal into independent signals. 
# 3. [TSNE: T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf). Maps high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional manifold attempting to maintain the local structure within the data. It is a non-linear technique and generally only used for visualization.
# 4. [UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426.pdf): A relatively new technique that also maps data to a low-dimensional manifold but tries to preserve more global structure than TSNE. 
# 
# All four of these methods are relatively simple to implement in Python. We'll map the selected features down to 3 dimensions for visualization and then also use PCA, ICA, and UMAP as features for modeling (TSNE has no `transform` method and hence cannot be used for preprocessing).

# # Conclusions
# 
# In this notebook, we went through a step-by-step implementation of an entire data science solution to a real-world problem. Machine learning is really just a series of steps, each simple by themselves, with the overall result often extremely powerful. 
# 
# Our path was as follows:
# 
# 1. Understand the problem
# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
#     * Deal with data issues
#     * Fill in missing values
# 3. Feature Engineering
#     * Aggregate data 
#     * Feature selection in stages
# 4. Model Selection
#     * Try many different models to see which one is most promising
#     * Feature selection can also come into play
# 5. Model Optimization
#     * Choose the best performing model and tune
# 6. Implementing best model
# 7. Investigate predictions
#     * Identify model shortcomings
# 8. Try new techniques
#     * Experiment and learn! 
#   
# As stated in the introduction, while these steps do have a general order, there is nothing preventing us from repeating them based on subsequent work. For example, we often go back to feature engineering/selection after modeling if we are not satisfied with our performance. After investigating predictions, we might return to the modeling stage and re-think our approach.
# 
# It's also important to keep in mind that machine learning is largely empirical: there are few established best practices so you need to constantly experiement to determine what works best. That's why we included the last step: we got to try out some new methods and even if they don't pay off for this project, they may be useful in the future. As data scientists we need to be constantly learning to do our work more effectively with the best tools possible.
# 
# Our final model does well compared to others in the competition, but overall is not extremely accurate. There might be ways to improve performance, but overall, we might not have enough data to achieve exceptional metrics. That's an important point to remember: at the end of the day, the success or failure of a data science project will rest on the quality and quantity of available data. We have solved the problem of classifying household poverty in Porto Rica as well as we can with the available tools, and the next process if we were in charge would be figuring out what more data could be collected to yield a better solution.
# 
# ## Next Steps
# 
# Although we tried many possible approaches, there are still some methods that we did not implement but might prove useful:
# 
# * Further Hyperparameter tuning: we did not spend much time optimizing the model and there are other packages for optimization that we could try. 
# * Further feature selection: we probably do not need to retain all of the features to get the same performance
# * [Oversampling the minority class](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/over_sampling.html) / undersampling the majority class: an advanced techinque that might improve performance
# * Ensembling or stacking multiple models. We could train models on different sections of the data and then combine their predictions to try and better separate the classes. It might also be worthwhile to include models other than the gradient boosting machine. 
# 
# The most valuable part of a Kaggle competition is never the rewards, but the knowledge gained along the way. These contests are great for learning how to solve realistic problems and I approach every new problem as an opportunity to improve as a data scientist. Thanks for reading!
