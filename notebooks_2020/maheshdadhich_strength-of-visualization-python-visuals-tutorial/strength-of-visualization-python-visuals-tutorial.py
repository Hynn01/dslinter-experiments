# #### NOTE- This is my first kaggle kernel, Please do let me know by upvoting if it proves to be of any use to you or if you have any suggestion/feedback, please comment, I will try to include and make it better for learning
# 
# # Preamble 
# I am always told that there are no good visualization libraries in python and also felt the same way when I saw "heads and tails" R notebook with ggplot2 and tidy. A thought wandered into my mind- is it really true ? are there no fancy visualization packages in python? So I started exploring them and found that it's absolutely wrong. So, **I will try to make this notebook as a visualization tutorial in python** and will be using data from NYC taxi competition to construct the visualizations. I will also be explaining in chronological order the way to interpret shown visualizations and how visualizations can provide beautiful ideas about new features. 
# 
# This notebook may also be used by beginners to understand the analytical thinking, how each step will be guiding us to next step will be explained thoroughly. We will have an interpretation of the plot right below it and ideas we get by that figure. I will try to make it as comprehensive as possible and will try to cover all the following packages -
# 
# | Serial No.  | Package     | Plots used in this kernel                          | Remark                              | Nature of plots
# | :----------:|:----------: | :-------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
# |1| **Matplotlib** |1. vendor_id histogram, 2. store and fwd flag histogram |Matplotlib is oldest and most widely used python visualization package, its a decade old but still its the first name come to our mind when it comes to plotting. Many libraries are built on top of it, and uses its functions in the backend. Its style is very simple and that's the reason plotting is fast in this. It is used to create axis and design the layout for plotting using other libraries like seaborn.| 
# |2| **Seaborn** |1.Violin plot (passenger count vs trip duration), 2. Boxplots( Weekday vs trip duration, 3. tsplot (hours, weekday vs avg trip duration), 4. distplots of lat-long, and trip_duration |Seaborn is my favorite plotting library (Not at all a fan of house greyjoy though :P) Plots from this package are soothing to eyes. Its build as a wrapper on matplotlib and many matplotlib's functions are also work with it.colors are amazing in this package's plots|
# |3|**Pandas**  | 1. Parallel coordinates (for cluster characteristics) | Pandas also offer many plotting functions and it's also a package built on matplotlib, so you need to know matplotlib to tweak the defaults of pandas. It offers Alluvial plots (which are nowhere near what R offers as alluvial plots) which are used in this notebook to show cluster characteristics.|
# |4|**Bokeh** |1. Time series plot (day of the year vs avg trip duration) | Bokeh is one great package which offers interactive plots, you can use bokeh with other libraries like seaborn, data-shader or holoviews, but bokeh its offers various different kind of plots. zoom, axis, and interactive legends makes bokeh different than others| **Interactive**
# |5|**Folium** | 1.pickup locations in Manhattan, 2. cluster's location in the USA, 3. clusters location in Manhattan | This package offers geographical-maps and that too are interactive in nature. This package offers a different kind of terrains for maps- stemmer terrain, open street maps to name a few. you can place bubble at the locations, shift the zoom, and scroll the plot left-right-up-down and add interactions, for example - cluster plots shown in this notebook offers information about clusters like number of vehicles going out, most frequently visited clusters etc. *kaggle started supporting this package during this competition only* |**interactive**
# |6|**Pygmaps** | 1. location visualizations 2. cluster visualizations | Pygmaps is available as archive package and can't even be installed using pip install command, but this package was the predecessor of gamps package but offers few great interactions which even gmaps doesn't offer. for example, a scattering of a cluster can be plotting with this one better than with gmaps. This package was way underdeveloped and developed version of it is know as gmaps yet, it was able to generate beautiful vizs. plots made my this package are best viewed in browsers.|**interactive**
# |7|**Plotly**| 1.bubble plot |This is another great package which offers colorful visualizations, but some of these beautiful plots require to interact with plotly server so you need API key and it will call the API.|**interactive**
# |8|**Gmaps**|*To be updated*|gmaps provide great features like- route features, and we all are too used to gmaps, so feel like home.|**interactive**
# |9|**Ggplot2** | 1. Weather plots of NYC for given period | gglots are now available in python as well, and its kind of in developing state and documentation is less of this package which makes it a little difficult but at the same time it provides very beautiful plots, so there is a tradeoff ;)|**interactive**
# |10|**Basemaps**| *Will not be added in this kernel*|As long as you are not developing any maps related library, there are no benefits of using basemaps. They offer many options but using them is difficult, due to lots of arguments, different style, and less amount of documentation, and many lines of codes sometimes will be required to plot a map.|
# |11|**No package**| 1. heatmaps of NYC taxi traffic |Instead of depending on data-shadder, I tried plotting the heatmap of traffic data with a row image, you will get to know the basics of image processing( reading image, color schemes that's all :P ) and how such basic exercise can result in traffic heatmap|
# |12|**Datashader**| 1.locations' heatmap| If you really have a very large size of data that you want to plot on a map, data shader is one of the best easiest option available in marker. But I found that row image processing and generating plots using a scipy.mics or cv2 is considerably faster than using this package.|**interactive**
# |13|**Holoviews**|1. Pairplot for feature interaction.|Holoviews is another alternative for making interactive visualizations, this package offers artistic plots. But you need really good RAM etc to use this package, else the notebook will get hang. plots exported to HTML works perfectly fine|**interactive**
# 
# *I have also included one **animation** in this notebook, using matplotlib's animation to show the pickup-drop heatmap for different hour of the day, i.e. density of pick-drops in different portion of the city with time.*
# 
# Some of the above packages are not supported by kaggle kernels and you have to download the notebook to get them working, I will put such plots in either appendix or will explicitly mention it above the cell creating such plots. After going through all these visualizations, I will use the extracted features to build a XGBoost model to do the predictions. The main motive of this notebook is to explore what is available, and how it can be used to visualize the data better.
# 
# 
# ## About Competition 
# In this competition, we are asked to build a model to predict trip duration for given pick and drop lat-long. We will keep on analyzing the data and extract features as we go forward with this notebook. Let's start getting our hands dirty with data.We will be using following datasets in this competition to generate a model and providing visuals -
# 
# | Serial No.  | Datasets used | Description |
# | :----------:|:----------: |:-----------------------------:|
# |1|NYC taxi train-test| Datasets provided as standard data for this competition.
# |2|NYC OSRM dataset| Dataset contains, fastest route, and second fastest route and path, trip duration information.
# |3|Weather data| Dataset contain, precipitation, snowfall etc for given time duration of data.

# ### Reading and checking the head of training data and data from OSRM fastest route dataset
# Training data is given as primary dataset for this competition and is available from the beginning of the competition. After almost 2 weeks from the start of this competition, oscarleo uploaded this dataset in Kaggle datasets. This dataset is generated from Open Source Routing Machine. This is similar to Gmaps but this is open source, so a user can make any number of queries using this engine ( Unlike Gmaps, where per day limit of free requests is 2000. Though I have compared the results of OSRM with that if Gmaps, Gmaps results considerably different than this one, almost all the results for time duration are different **with the same fraction**. So, while training any regressor, it will help very much in predicting trip duration. I am importing both of these datasets in the start of our analysis.

# ### Lets visualize the trip duration given using log-scale distplot in sns
# We are asked to predict trip_duration of the test set, so we first check what kind of trips durations are present in the dataset. First I plotted it on a plain scale and not on a log scale, and some of the records have very long trip durations ~100 hours. Such long trips are making all another trip invisible in the histogram on plain scale => We go ahead with the log scale. Another reason of using the log scale for visualizing trip-duration on the log scale is that this competition uses rmsle matrix so it would make sense to visualize the target variable in log scale only.

# **Findings** - It is clear with the above histogram and kernel density plot that the trip-durations are like Gaussian and few trips have very large duration, like ~350000 seconds which is 100 hours (which is weird, as long as it isn't an intercity taxi ride from NYC to SF or Alaska), while most of the trips are e^4 = 1 minute to e^8 ~ 60 minutes. and probably are taken inside Manhattan or in new york only. Let's check the lat-long distributions are then used them to have a heat map kind of view of given lat-longs.

# **Findings** - From the plot above it is clear that pick and drop latitude are centered around 40 to 41, and longitude are situated around -74 ton-73. We are not getting any histogram kind of plots when we are plotting lat-long as the distplot function of sns is getting affected by outliers, trips which are very far from each other like lat 32 to lat 44, are taking very long time, and have affected this plot such that it is coming off as a spike. Let's remove those large duration trip by using a cap on lat-long and visualize the distributions of latitude and longitude given to us.

# **Findings** - We put the following caps on lat-long -

# 
# We get that the distribution spikes becomes as distribution in distplot (distplot is a histogram plot in seaborn package), we can see that most of the trips are getting concentrated between these lat-long only. Let's plot them on an empty image and check what kind of a city map we are getting as we can't use gmaps and folium on kaggle kernel for visualizations.

# ## Heatmap of coordinates
# ### Let's do basic image processing here 
# We have taken an empty image and make it a color it black so that we can see colors where the lat-longs are falling. To visualize we need to consider each point of this image as a point represented by lat-long, to achieve that we will bring the lat-long to image coordinate range and then take a summary of lat-long and their count, assign a different color for different count range. Running next cell will result in beautiful visualization shown below.
# 
# This is the very low-level implementation of making plots. As in the early stage of competition people using R was making plots on leaflet and we, Python users were missing gmaps and folium in kaggle kernel's python docker, I requested them to get the folium installed but it took some time and I wasn't aware of the "datashader" package that time.So, I decided to use the knowledge I gained in last kaggle competition I participated in (Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring) and made such plots using basic image processing.

# **Findings** - From the heatmap kind of image above -
# - Red points signifies that 1-10 trips in the given data have that point as pickup point
# - Green points signifies that more than 10-50 trips in the given data have that point as pickup point 
# - Yellow points signifies that more than 50+ trips in the given data have that point as pickup point
# 
# Clearly, the whole manhattan is yellow colored and with few green points as well, that shows that in Manhatten most of the trips are getting originated.  This is the basic way in which you can plot large geospatial data in an empty image without being dependent on any package. But if you hate image processing, you can use **datashader**, datashader is a package which is used to show billions of data points on an image, they also use the similar approach with a different color gradient.
# Thought I will also show the same plot with a sample data of 1000 trips on pygmaps in next few cell. it will generate an HTML in output and user has to open that HTML in the browser.

# ## Let's define few functions to unfold features in the given data 
# We are supposed to predict trip_duration for given rides, for that we have to do some feature engineering and find out features which are affecting the trip-duration between a given pickup and drop-off locations. We are given lat-log => distance features can be calculated, we are given DateTime => DateTime features can be calculated, we are given variables like vendor_id, store_n_fwd_flag which themselves would act like features. Lets formally begin feature extraction ...

# # Features' Exploration (Checking if we have any explainable pattern) -
# Even if we don't visualize these features we can make model and model will predict the trip_duration, then why are we visualizing? - Because - it will give us an explanation of model's output and will give us some pattern which may even guide if we should make multiple models, or one model if we should include that particular variable or there is no sense in including that variable. in short - it will give us new ideas to make a model. 
# **Note** - Basically in consulting world, if you can't explain model it won't sell, and without visuals, it's very hard to explain patterns.
# - **1. Let's check the average time taken by two different vendors vs weekday**

# **Findings** - it's clear that the vendor 1 is taking more time than vendor 2 on all the days of the week, we can also subset data frame based on the month and that will also give us the same results. The difference between the average time taken by vendor 1 is ~250 seconds more than vendor 2. 

# ### Violin Plot -
# When someone says seaborn, two things come to my mind first greyjoys ( GOT fan I am ;) ) and second violin plots, I know seaborn package because of it's violin plots, so I will explain the distributions of next variable with violin plots. Following are few facts about violin plots -  
# - Violin plot can be made using seaborn package in python and with split
# - Here we are using them to check the distributions, and horizontal lines inside them shows the quartiles
# - Green one is vendor 1 and red one is vendor 2 and trip_duration is plotted on log scale

# In[ ]:

               inner="quart",palette={1: "g", 2: "r"})

sns.despine(left=True)
print(df.shape[0])


# **Findings** -
# - There are trips for both the vendor with zeros passengers and few of these trips have negative time as well, I don't understand how can a taxi trip have negative time, possibly they aren't right data points to train the model, we would remove them before making model
# - Trips with zero passengers can be trips when a taxi is called to a particular location and the customer is charged for getting the taxi there, that is one possible explanation.
# - Distributions are similar for both the vendors, but vendor one has more number of larger trips than vendor two for passenger count 2 and 3
# - There are very less number of trips with passenger count 7, 8 and 9

# ## Box-Plots 
# **Interpretation**
# - Most popular plots to check the distribution of variables
# - box covers data from second and third quadrant and rest is shorn by bars
# - Dots on the both side of bars shows outliers

# **Findings** -
# - From the boxplot above we can see that 75%ile of avg trip duration on Sunday(0) and Saturday(6) is less than 2000 seconds. i.e. around 33 minutes
# - Time taken by Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are greater than rest of the days.

# ## line-plots 
# - Simple lineplots can explain how the trip duration is changing with time for different days of week
# - very easy to interpret

# **findings** - 
# - Its clear from the above plot that on day 0, that is Sunday and day 6 that is Saturday, the trip duration is very less that all the weekdays at 5 AM to 15 AM time. 
# - See this, on  Saturday around midnight, the rides are taking far more than usual time, this is obvious through now verified  using given data

# # Cluster analysis and visualization
# # But, Why should I make clusters ?? 
# #### Coz, Uber uses it, hell NO!! 
# #### Coz, Everyone in this competition is using it, Hell NO!!
# #### Coz - 
# 
# When I started writing this kernel and working for this competition, The most easy approach that came to my mind to use Gmaps, use in some way hacking to request trip-duration for given lat-long, So I have started writing code for calling google gmaps API, but latter found that using gmaps distance matrix API only 2000 requests can be processed. So, My initial plan got failed, and remaining of which I have kept in Appendix of this kernel :P 
# 
# So, 2000 requests can be processed right? I thought okay let's make groups for which I will make the API requests and then using some approximation ( haversine distance or any distance and avg vendor speed) I will predict the ride time), So 45C2 = 1980, So settled with 45 clusters that time. =>That's where it struck me that clustering can be a very important feature even if we don't use distance matrix. Clustering can give us many pieces of information like - if we know pickup is in cluster 4 and drop is in cluster 9, and max flow from cluster 4 is to cluster 9, we will know that the trip-duration is going to be more than otherwise. 
# 
# ** That's exactly the way Uber decides surge pricing, if there is more flow from x cluster to z cluster, surge will be different, and from x to w surge will be different and will be less than x to z trip.** 
# 
# As now Kaggle has folium package installed, so I will be using folium package for visualizations and we will be visualizing clusters on maps. Folium is map-based interactive package and it's open source as well. It's based on leaflet js, it is great to see that finally python docker (kaggle) too have such nice map package available. It is interactive in nature, balloons on the map can be clicked and they will show characteristics of that clusters.( flow of rides and what not, you can code anything..)

So, a list of the significant cluster can be passed to summarized those clusters. Significant clusters are clusters having more than 70 thousand rides as the pickup location. Then we will make three plots using folium -

# 2. Showing all clusters on Map of America 
# 3. Showing significant clusters on osm terrain

# Folium provides various features, the first thing their plots are interactive in nature, Like the plots I have made below are also interactive in nature. When you click on the cluster centroid balloon, it will tell the characteristics of clusters, you can choose plot type, terrain type, and anything, you can zoom and even save them as HTML document.

# **Findings** - Clearly In Feb, the temperature falls to 0, and it should have affected the rides as when we check the similar time searies plot of the date vs trip_duration, we can see that trip_duration for both vendors are much large than usual on this day. Let's check just for fun the snowfall and snow depth's chart. we can see that temp on particular day may have some effect on trip_duration, In my opinion that information is covered in day_of_year variable so including this data as a feature will be relectant.

# - Variables like pick_month, week_of_year, day_of_year etc are of very less importance and are not at all related to other variables.
# - OSRM variables are very important => correlation is as high as 0.8
# - Strong correlation is observed between different IDVs but we will be using tree based model so No need to remove those variables which are highly correlated. ( thought try removing for Robustness of model)

# From Above visualization on google maps, its clear that most of the cabs rides are situated in manhatten and few in the lesf of manhattan and few on the right. Few rides' pick drop are very far from manhattan, but there are suchs rides, like going to Airport JFK, and few rides locations are in SF, california. So, which brings us to idea of clsuteing them and then analysing where the clusters are falling. Expected is that most of the clusters will fall in manhattan and few will fall nearby manhattan.
# 
# Except it clustering is very advisible as total number of queries in train data is ~1.4M, which is very larger number , and using google map's distance matrix the pickup address, drop address, and shortest path distance for cars, and avg time taken from pickup tpo drop is not possible as free query limit is 2500 queries per day. so, if we do clustering and we reduce the number of queries, we ca use distance matrix's data for going from centroid of one cluster to another and then using normal, haversine or manhattan distance for going from centroid of cluster to destination.
