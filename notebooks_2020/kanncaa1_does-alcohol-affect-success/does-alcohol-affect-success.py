# **INTRODUCTION**
# * The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. You can use it for some EDA or try to predict students final grade.
# * Correlation between features
# * Weekly Consumption of Alcohol
# * Final Exam Scores According to Students' alcohol consumption
# * Students grade with grade average according to alcohol consumption
# *  Alcohol consumption: 1 time  is very  low and 10 times are very high

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import seaborn as sns # visualize
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

data = pd.read_csv('../input/student-mat.csv')


# In[3]:


# I use final grade = G3, and weekly alcohol consumption = Dalc + Walc 
data.columns


# **Correlation between features**
# * For broad perspective lets look at first correlation of features.

# In[4]:



plt.figure(figsize=(15,15))
sns.heatmap(data.corr(),annot = True,fmt = ".2f",cbar = True)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.yticks(rotation = 0)


# As it can be seen from correlation map only exam scoreas are highly correlated with each other. It says that if students takes almost same grade at each exams.

# I am goint to combine weekdays alcohol consumption with weekend alcoho consumption.

# In[5]:


data['Dalc'] = data['Dalc'] + data['Walc']


# **Weekly Consumption of Alcohol**
# * Students drink alcohol at least 2 times in a week.

# In[6]:


# There is no student who does not consume alcohol. However, all students at least 2 times in a week consume alcohol.
list = []
for i in range(11):
    list.append(len(data[data.Dalc == i]))
ax = sns.barplot(x = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], y = list)
plt.ylabel('Number of Students')
plt.xlabel('Weekly alcohol consumption')


# **Final Exam Scores According to Students' alcohol consumption**
# * I visualize taken total grades according to alcohol consuption

# In[7]:


labels = ['2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10']
colors = ['lime','blue','orange','cyan','grey','purple','brown','red','darksalmon']
explode = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
sizes = []
for i in range(2,11):
    sizes.append(sum(data[data.Dalc == i].G3))
total_grade = sum(sizes)
average = total_grade/float(len(data))
plt.pie(sizes,explode=explode,colors=colors,labels=labels,autopct = '%1.1f%%')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.title('Total grade : '+str(total_grade))
plt.xlabel('Students grade distribution according to weekly alcohol consumption')


# Well, it looks like students who consume alcohol 2 times in a week more successful than others. However, it actually cannot be understood from this graph. Because number of students who consume alcohol 2 times in a week more than others. Therefore, lets look at swarm plot to understand whether alcohol affects the success or not.

# **Students grade with grade average according to alcohol consumption **
# * Final exam average grade is 10.4
# * In order to understand whether alcohol affects students success, I compare grades with average.

# In[8]:


ave = sum(data.G3)/float(len(data))
data['ave_line'] = ave
data['average'] = ['above average' if i > ave else 'under average' for i in data.G3]
sns.swarmplot(x='Dalc', y = 'G3', hue = 'average',data= data,palette={'above average':'lime', 'under average': 'red'})


# As it can be seen swarm plot, student who takes highest grade consumes alcohol only 2 times in a week.

# In[9]:


sum(data[data.Dalc == 2].G3)/float(len(data[data.Dalc == 2]))


# In[10]:


# Average grade
list = []
for i in range(2,11):
    list.append(sum(data[data.Dalc == i].G3)/float(len(data[data.Dalc == i])))
ax = sns.barplot(x = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], y = list)
plt.ylabel('Average Grades of students')
plt.xlabel('Weekly alcohol consumption')
