# # About this Notebook
# 
# NLP is a very hot topic right now and as belived by many experts '2020 is going to be NLP's Year' ,with its ever changing dynamics it is experiencing a boom , same as computer vision once did. Owing to its popularity Kaggle launched two NLP competitions recently and me being a lover of this Hot topic prepared myself to join in my first Kaggle Competition.<br><br>
# As I joined the competitions and since I was a complete beginner with Deep Learning Techniques for NLP, all my enthusiasm took a beating when I saw everyone Using all  kinds of BERT , everything just went over my head,I thought to quit but there is a special thing about Kaggle ,it just hooks you. I thought I have to learn someday , why not now , so I braced myself and sat on the learning curve. I wrote a kernel on the Tweet Sentiment Extraction competition that has now got a gold medal , it can be viewed here : https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/twitter-sentiment-extaction-analysis-eda-and-model <br><br>
# After 10 days of extensive learning(finishing all the latest NLP approaches) , I am back here to share my leaning , by writing a kernel that starts from the very Basic RNN's to built over , all the way to BERT . I invite you all to come and learn alongside with me and take a step closer towards becoming an NLP expert

# # Contents
# 
# In this Notebook I will start with the very Basics of RNN's and Build all the way to latest deep learning architectures to solve NLP problems. It will cover the Following:
# * Simple RNN's
# * Word Embeddings : Definition and How to get them
# * LSTM's
# * GRU's
# * BI-Directional RNN's
# * Encoder-Decoder Models (Seq2Seq Models)
# * Attention Models
# * Transformers - Attention is all you need
# * BERT
# 
# I will divide every Topic into four subsections:
# * Basic Overview
# * In-Depth Understanding : In this I will attach links of articles and videos to learn about the topic in depth
# * Code-Implementation
# * Code Explanation
# 
# This is a comprehensive kernel and if you follow along till the end , I promise you would learn all the techniques completely
# 
# Note that the aim of this notebook is not to have a High LB score but to present a beginner guide to understand Deep Learning techniques used for NLP. Also after discussing all of these ideas , I will present a starter solution for this competiton

# **<span style="color:Red">This kernel has been a work of more than 10 days If you find my kernel useful and my efforts appreciable, Please Upvote it , it motivates me to write more Quality content**

# # Simple RNN
# 
# ## Basic Overview
# 
# What is a RNN?
# 
# Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words. Thus RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer.

# ## Code Implementation
# 
# So first I will implement the and then I will explain the code step by step

# In[ ]:


# using keras tokenizer here
token = text.Tokenizer(num_words=None)
max_len = 1500

token.fit_on_texts(list(xtrain) + list(xvalid))
xtrain_seq = token.texts_to_sequences(xtrain)
xvalid_seq = token.texts_to_sequences(xvalid)

#zero pad the sequences
xtrain_pad = sequence.pad_sequences(xtrain_seq, maxlen=max_len)
xvalid_pad = sequence.pad_sequences(xvalid_seq, maxlen=max_len)

word_index = token.word_index


# In[ ]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('time', '', "with strategy.scope():\n    # A simpleRNN without any pretrained embeddings and one dense layer\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Embedding(len(word_index) + 1,\n                     300,\n                     input_length=max_len))\n    model.add(SimpleRNN(100))\n    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n    \nmodel.summary()")


# In[ ]:


model.fit(xtrain_pad, ytrain, nb_epoch=5, batch_size=64*strategy.num_replicas_in_sync) #Multiplying by Strategy to run on TPU's


# In[ ]:


scores = model.predict(xvalid_pad)
print("Auc: %.2f%%" % (roc_auc(scores,yvalid)))


# In[ ]:


scores_model = []
scores_model.append({'Model': 'SimpleRNN','AUC_Score': roc_auc(scores,yvalid)})


# ## Code Explanantion
# * Tokenization<br><br>
#  So if you have watched the videos and referred to the links, you would know that in an RNN we input a sentence word by word. We represent every word as one hot vectors of dimensions : Numbers of words in Vocab +1. <br>
#   What keras Tokenizer does is , it takes all the unique words in the corpus,forms a dictionary with words as keys and their number of occurences as values,it then sorts the dictionary in descending order of counts. It then assigns the first value 1 , second value 2 and so on. So let's suppose word 'the' occured the most in the corpus then it will assigned index 1 and vector representing 'the' would be a one-hot vector with value 1 at position 1 and rest zereos.<br>
#   Try printing first 2 elements of xtrain_seq you will see every word is represented as a digit now

# In[ ]:


xtrain_seq[:1]


# <b>Now you might be wondering What is padding? Why its done</b><br><br>
# 
# Here is the answer :
# * https://www.quora.com/Which-effect-does-sequence-padding-have-on-the-training-of-a-neural-network
# * https://machinelearningmastery.com/data-preparation-variable-length-input-sequences-sequence-prediction/
# * https://www.coursera.org/lecture/natural-language-processing-tensorflow/padding-2Cyzs
# 
# Also sometimes people might use special tokens while tokenizing like EOS(end of string) and BOS(Begining of string). Here is the reason why it's done
# * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44579161/why-do-we-do-padding-in-nlp-tasks
# 
# 
# The code token.word_index simply gives the dictionary of vocab that keras created for us

# * Building the Neural Network
# 
# To understand the Dimensions of input and output given to RNN in keras her is a beautiful article : https://medium.com/@shivajbd/understanding-input-and-output-shape-in-lstm-keras-c501ee95c65e
# 
# The first line model.Sequential() tells keras that we will be building our network sequentially . Then we first add the Embedding layer.
# Embedding layer is also a layer of neurons which takes in as input the nth dimensional one hot vector of every word and converts it into 300 dimensional vector , it gives us word embeddings similar to word2vec. We could have used word2vec but the embeddings layer learns during training to enhance the embeddings.
# Next we add an 100 LSTM units without any dropout or regularization
# At last we add a single neuron with sigmoid function which takes output from 100 LSTM cells (Please note we have 100 LSTM cells not layers) to predict the results and then we compile the model using adam optimizer 
# 
# * Comments on the model<br><br>
# We can see our model achieves an accuracy of 1 which is just insane , we are clearly overfitting I know , but this was the simplest model of all ,we can tune a lot of hyperparameters like RNN units, we can do batch normalization , dropouts etc to get better result. The point is we got an AUC score of 0.82 without much efforts and we know have learnt about RNN's .Deep learning is really revolutionary

# # Word Embeddings
# 
# While building our simple RNN models we talked about using word-embeddings , So what is word-embeddings and how do we get word-embeddings?
# Here is the answer :
# * https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/lecture/6Oq70/word-representation
# * https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/
# <br> <br>
# The latest approach to getting word Embeddings is using pretained GLoVe or using Fasttext. Without going into too much details, I would explain how to create sentence vectors and how can we use them to create a machine learning model on top of it and since I am a fan of GloVe vectors, word2vec and fasttext. In this Notebook, I'll be using the GloVe vectors. You can download the GloVe vectors from here http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip or you can search for GloVe in datasets on Kaggle and add the file

# In[ ]:


# load the GloVe vectors in a dictionary:

embeddings_index = {}
f = open('/kaggle/input/glove840b300dtxt/glove.840B.300d.txt','r',encoding='utf-8')
for line in tqdm(f):
    values = line.split(' ')
    word = values[0]
    coefs = np.asarray([float(val) for val in values[1:]])
    embeddings_index[word] = coefs
f.close()

print('Found %s word vectors.' % len(embeddings_index))


# # LSTM's
# 
# ## Basic Overview
# 
# Simple RNN's were certainly better than classical ML algorithms and gave state of the art results, but it failed to capture long term dependencies that is present in sentences . So in 1998-99 LSTM's were introduced to counter to these drawbacks.
# 
# ## In Depth Understanding
# 
# Why LSTM's?

# * https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21
# 
# # Code Implementation
# 
# We have already tokenized and paded our text for input to LSTM's

# In[ ]:


# create an embedding matrix for the words we have in the dataset
embedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(word_index) + 1, 300))
for word, i in tqdm(word_index.items()):
    embedding_vector = embeddings_index.get(word)
    if embedding_vector is not None:
        embedding_matrix[i] = embedding_vector


# In[ ]:


get_ipython().run_cell_magic('time', '', "with strategy.scope():\n    \n    # A simple LSTM with glove embeddings and one dense layer\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Embedding(len(word_index) + 1,\n                     300,\n                     weights=[embedding_matrix],\n                     input_length=max_len,\n                     trainable=False))\n\n    model.add(LSTM(100, dropout=0.3, recurrent_dropout=0.3))\n    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])\n    \nmodel.summary()")


# In[ ]:


model.fit(xtrain_pad, ytrain, nb_epoch=5, batch_size=64*strategy.num_replicas_in_sync)


# In[ ]:


scores = model.predict(xvalid_pad)
print("Auc: %.2f%%" % (roc_auc(scores,yvalid)))


# In[ ]:


scores_model.append({'Model': 'LSTM','AUC_Score': roc_auc(scores,yvalid)})


# ## Code Explanation
# 
# As a first step we calculate embedding matrix for our vocabulary from the pretrained GLoVe vectors . Then while building the embedding layer we pass Embedding Matrix as weights to the layer instead of training it over Vocabulary and thus we pass trainable = False.
# Rest of the model is same as before except we have replaced the SimpleRNN By LSTM Units
# 
# * Comments on the Model
# 
# We now see that the model is not overfitting and achieves an auc score of 0.96 which is quite commendable , also we close in on the gap between accuracy and auc .
# We see that in this case we used dropout and prevented overfitting the data

# # GRU's
# 
# ## Basic  Overview
# 
# Introduced by Cho, et al. in 2014, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) aims to solve the vanishing gradient problem which comes with a standard recurrent neural network. GRU's are a variation on the LSTM because both are designed similarly and, in some cases, produce equally excellent results . GRU's were designed to be simpler and faster than LSTM's and in most cases produce equally good results and thus there is no clear winner.

# ## Code Explanation
# 
# Code is same as before,only we have added bidirectional nature to the LSTM cells we used before and is self explanatory. We have achieve similar accuracy and auc score as before and now we have learned all the types of typical RNN architectures

# # Seq2Seq Model Architecture
# 
# ## Overview
# 
# RNN's are of many types  and different architectures are used for different purposes. Here is a nice video explanining different types of model architectures : https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/lecture/BO8PS/different-types-of-rnns.
# Seq2Seq is a many to many RNN architecture where the input is a sequence and the output is also a sequence (where input and output sequences can be or cannot be of different lengths). This architecture is used in a lot of applications like Machine Translation, text summarization, question answering etc

# # Attention Models
# 
# This is the toughest and most tricky part. If you are able to understand the intiuition and working of attention block , understanding transformers and transformer based architectures like BERT will be a piece of cake. This is the part where I spent the most time on and I suggest you do the same . Please read and view the following resources in the order I am providing to ignore getting confused, also at the end of this try to write and draw an attention block in your own way :-

# # Transformers : Attention is all you need
# 
# So finally we have reached the end of the learning curve and are about to start learning the technology that changed NLP completely and are the reasons for the state of the art NLP techniques .Transformers were introduced in the paper Attention is all you need by Google. If you have understood the Attention models,this will be very easy , Here is transformers fully explained:

# # BERT and Its Implementation on this Competition
# 
# As Promised I am back with Resiurces , to understand about BERT architecture , please follow the contents in the given order :-
# 
# * http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/ ---> In Depth Understanding of BERT
# 
# After going through the post Above , I guess you must have understood how transformer architecture have been utilized by the current SOTA models . Now these architectures can be used in two ways :<br><br>
# 1) We can use the model for prediction on our problems using the pretrained weights without fine-tuning or training the model for our sepcific tasks
# * EG: http://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/ ---> Using Pre-trained BERT without Tuning
# 
# 2) We can fine-tune or train these transformer models for our task by tweaking the already pre-trained weights and training on a much smaller dataset
# * EG:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hinZO--TEk4&t=2933s ---> Tuning BERT For your TASK
# 
# We will be using the first example as a base for our implementation of BERT model using Hugging Face and KERAS , but contrary to first example we will also Fine-Tune our model for our task

# This was my effort to share my learnings so that everyone can benifit from it.As this community has been very kind to me and helped me in learning all of this , I want to take this forward. I have shared all the resources I used to learn all the stuff .Join me and make these NLP competitions your first ,without being overwhelmed by the shear number of techniques used . It took me 10 days to learn all of this , you can learn it at your pace and dont give in , at the end of all this you will be a different person and it will all be worth it.
