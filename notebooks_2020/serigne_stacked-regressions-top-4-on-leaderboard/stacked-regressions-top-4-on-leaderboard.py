# **If you use parts of this notebook in your scripts/notebooks, giving  some kind of credit would be very much appreciated :)  You can for instance link back to this notebook. Thanks!**

# This competition is very important to me as  it helped me to begin my journey on Kaggle few months ago. I've read  some great notebooks here. To name a few:
# 
# 1. [Comprehensive data exploration with Python][1] by **Pedro Marcelino**  : Great and very motivational data analysis
# 
# 2. [A study on Regression applied to the Ames dataset][2] by **Julien Cohen-Solal**  : Thorough features engeneering and deep dive into linear regression analysis  but really easy to follow for beginners.
# 
# 3. [Regularized Linear Models][3] by **Alexandru Papiu**  : Great Starter kernel on modelling and Cross-validation
# 
# I can't recommend enough every beginner to go carefully through these kernels (and of course through many others great kernels) and get their first insights in data science and kaggle competitions.
# 
# After that (and some basic pratices) you should be more confident to go through [this great script][7] by **Human Analog**  who did an impressive work on features engeneering. 
# 
# As the dataset is particularly handy, I  decided few days ago to get back in this competition and apply things I learnt so far, especially stacking models. For that purpose, we build two stacking classes  ( the simplest approach and a less simple one). 
# 
# As these classes are written for general purpose, you can easily adapt them and/or extend them for your regression problems. 
# The overall approach is  hopefully concise and easy to follow.. 
# 
# The features engeneering is rather parsimonious (at least compared to some others great scripts) . It is pretty much :
# 
# - **Imputing missing values**  by proceeding sequentially through the data
# 
# - **Transforming** some numerical variables that seem really categorical
# 
# - **Label Encoding** some categorical variables that may contain information in their ordering set
# 
# -  [**Box Cox Transformation**][4] of skewed features (instead of log-transformation) : This gave me a **slightly better result** both on leaderboard and cross-validation.
# 
# - ** Getting dummy variables** for categorical features. 
# 
# Then we choose many base models (mostly sklearn based models + sklearn API of  DMLC's [XGBoost][5] and Microsoft's [LightGBM][6]), cross-validate them on the data before stacking/ensembling them. The key here is to make the (linear) models robust to outliers. This improved the result both on LB and cross-validation.

# 
# To my surprise, this does well on LB ( 0.11420 and top 4% the last time I tested it : **July 2, 2017** )
# 
# 

# **Hope that at the end of this notebook, stacking will be clear for those, like myself, who found the concept not so easy to grasp**

# #Data Processing

# ##Outliers

# [Documentation][1] for the Ames Housing Data indicates that there are outliers present in the training data
# [1]: http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/Decock/DataDocumentation.txt

# Let's explore these outliers
# 

# In[ ]:



fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x = train['GrLivArea'], y = train['SalePrice'])
plt.ylabel('SalePrice', fontsize=13)
plt.xlabel('GrLivArea', fontsize=13)
plt.show()


# We can see at the bottom right two with extremely large GrLivArea that are of a low price. These values are huge oultliers.
# Therefore, we can safely delete them.

# In[ ]:


#Deleting outliers
train = train.drop(train[(train['GrLivArea']>4000) & (train['SalePrice']<300000)].index)

#Check the graphic again
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(train['GrLivArea'], train['SalePrice'])
plt.ylabel('SalePrice', fontsize=13)
plt.xlabel('GrLivArea', fontsize=13)
plt.show()


# ###Note : 
#  Outliers removal is note always safe.  We decided to delete these two as they are very huge and  really  bad ( extremely large areas for very low  prices). 
# 
# There are probably others outliers in the training data.   However, removing all them  may affect badly our models if ever there were also  outliers  in the test data. That's why , instead of removing them all, we will just manage to make some of our  models robust on them. You can refer to  the modelling part of this notebook for that. 

# ##Target Variable

# **SalePrice** is the variable we need to predict. So let's do some analysis on this variable first.

# In[ ]:


sns.distplot(train['SalePrice'] , fit=norm);

# Get the fitted parameters used by the function
(mu, sigma) = norm.fit(train['SalePrice'])
print( '\n mu = {:.2f} and sigma = {:.2f}\n'.format(mu, sigma))

#Now plot the distribution
plt.legend(['Normal dist. ($\mu=$ {:.2f} and $\sigma=$ {:.2f} )'.format(mu, sigma)],
            loc='best')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('SalePrice distribution')

#Get also the QQ-plot
fig = plt.figure()
res = stats.probplot(train['SalePrice'], plot=plt)
plt.show()


# The target variable is right skewed.  As (linear) models love normally distributed data , we need to transform this variable and make it more normally distributed.

#  **Log-transformation of the target variable**

# In[ ]:


#We use the numpy fuction log1p which  applies log(1+x) to all elements of the column
train["SalePrice"] = np.log1p(train["SalePrice"])

#Check the new distribution 
sns.distplot(train['SalePrice'] , fit=norm);

# Get the fitted parameters used by the function
(mu, sigma) = norm.fit(train['SalePrice'])
print( '\n mu = {:.2f} and sigma = {:.2f}\n'.format(mu, sigma))

#Now plot the distribution
plt.legend(['Normal dist. ($\mu=$ {:.2f} and $\sigma=$ {:.2f} )'.format(mu, sigma)],
            loc='best')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('SalePrice distribution')

#Get also the QQ-plot
fig = plt.figure()
res = stats.probplot(train['SalePrice'], plot=plt)
plt.show()


# The skew seems now corrected and the data appears more normally distributed. 

# ##Features engineering

# let's first  concatenate the train and test data in the same dataframe

# In[ ]:


ntrain = train.shape[0]
ntest = test.shape[0]
y_train = train.SalePrice.values
all_data = pd.concat((train, test)).reset_index(drop=True)
all_data.drop(['SalePrice'], axis=1, inplace=True)
print("all_data size is : {}".format(all_data.shape))


# ###Missing Data

# In[ ]:


all_data_na = (all_data.isnull().sum() / len(all_data)) * 100
all_data_na = all_data_na.drop(all_data_na[all_data_na == 0].index).sort_values(ascending=False)[:30]
missing_data = pd.DataFrame({'Missing Ratio' :all_data_na})
missing_data.head(20)


# In[ ]:


f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 12))
plt.xticks(rotation='90')
sns.barplot(x=all_data_na.index, y=all_data_na)
plt.xlabel('Features', fontsize=15)
plt.ylabel('Percent of missing values', fontsize=15)
plt.title('Percent missing data by feature', fontsize=15)


# **Data Correlation**
# 

# In[ ]:


#Correlation map to see how features are correlated with SalePrice
corrmat = train.corr()
plt.subplots(figsize=(12,9))
sns.heatmap(corrmat, vmax=0.9, square=True)


# ###Imputing missing values 

# We impute them  by proceeding sequentially  through features with missing values 

# - **PoolQC** : data description says NA means "No  Pool". That make sense, given the huge ratio of missing value (+99%) and majority of houses have no Pool at all in general. 

# In[ ]:


all_data["PoolQC"] = all_data["PoolQC"].fillna("None")


# - **MiscFeature** : data description says NA means "no misc feature"
# 

# In[ ]:


all_data["MiscFeature"] = all_data["MiscFeature"].fillna("None")


# - **Alley** : data description says NA means "no alley access"

# In[ ]:


all_data["Alley"] = all_data["Alley"].fillna("None")


# - **Fence** : data description says NA means "no fence"

# In[ ]:


all_data["Fence"] = all_data["Fence"].fillna("None")


# - **FireplaceQu** : data description says NA means "no fireplace"

# In[ ]:


all_data["FireplaceQu"] = all_data["FireplaceQu"].fillna("None")


# - **LotFrontage** : Since the area of each street connected to the house property most likely have a similar area to other houses in its neighborhood , we can **fill in missing values by the median LotFrontage of the neighborhood**.

# In[ ]:


#Group by neighborhood and fill in missing value by the median LotFrontage of all the neighborhood
all_data["LotFrontage"] = all_data.groupby("Neighborhood")["LotFrontage"].transform(
    lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))


# - **GarageType, GarageFinish, GarageQual and GarageCond** : Replacing missing data with None

# In[ ]:


for col in ('GarageType', 'GarageFinish', 'GarageQual', 'GarageCond'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna('None')


# - **GarageYrBlt, GarageArea and GarageCars** : Replacing missing data with 0 (Since No garage = no cars in such garage.)
# 

# In[ ]:


for col in ('GarageYrBlt', 'GarageArea', 'GarageCars'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna(0)


# - **BsmtFinSF1, BsmtFinSF2, BsmtUnfSF, TotalBsmtSF, BsmtFullBath and BsmtHalfBath** : missing values are likely zero for having no basement

# In[ ]:


for col in ('BsmtFinSF1', 'BsmtFinSF2', 'BsmtUnfSF','TotalBsmtSF', 'BsmtFullBath', 'BsmtHalfBath'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna(0)


# - **BsmtQual, BsmtCond, BsmtExposure, BsmtFinType1 and BsmtFinType2** : For all these categorical basement-related features, NaN means that there is no  basement.
# 

# In[ ]:


for col in ('BsmtQual', 'BsmtCond', 'BsmtExposure', 'BsmtFinType1', 'BsmtFinType2'):
    all_data[col] = all_data[col].fillna('None')


# - **MasVnrArea and MasVnrType** : NA most likely means no masonry veneer for these houses. We can fill 0 for the area and None for the type. 
# 

# In[ ]:


all_data["MasVnrType"] = all_data["MasVnrType"].fillna("None")
all_data["MasVnrArea"] = all_data["MasVnrArea"].fillna(0)


# - **MSZoning (The general zoning classification)** :  'RL' is by far  the most common value.  So we can fill in missing values with 'RL'
# 

# In[ ]:


all_data['MSZoning'] = all_data['MSZoning'].fillna(all_data['MSZoning'].mode()[0])


# - **Utilities** : For this categorical feature all records are "AllPub", except for one "NoSeWa"  and 2 NA . Since the house with 'NoSewa' is in the training set, **this feature won't help in predictive modelling**. We can then safely  remove it.
# 

# In[ ]:


all_data = all_data.drop(['Utilities'], axis=1)


# - **Functional** : data description says NA means typical

# In[ ]:


all_data["Functional"] = all_data["Functional"].fillna("Typ")


# - **Electrical** : It has one NA value. Since this feature has mostly 'SBrkr', we can set that for the missing value.
# 

# In[ ]:


all_data['Electrical'] = all_data['Electrical'].fillna(all_data['Electrical'].mode()[0])


# - **KitchenQual**: Only one NA value, and same as Electrical, we set 'TA' (which is the most frequent)  for the missing value in KitchenQual.
# 

# In[ ]:


all_data['KitchenQual'] = all_data['KitchenQual'].fillna(all_data['KitchenQual'].mode()[0])


# - **Exterior1st and Exterior2nd** : Again Both Exterior 1 & 2 have only one missing value. We will just substitute in the most common string
# 

# In[ ]:


all_data['Exterior1st'] = all_data['Exterior1st'].fillna(all_data['Exterior1st'].mode()[0])
all_data['Exterior2nd'] = all_data['Exterior2nd'].fillna(all_data['Exterior2nd'].mode()[0])


# - **SaleType** : Fill in again with most frequent which is "WD"

# In[ ]:


all_data['SaleType'] = all_data['SaleType'].fillna(all_data['SaleType'].mode()[0])


# - **MSSubClass** : Na most likely means No building class. We can replace missing values with None
# 

# In[ ]:



all_data['MSSubClass'] = all_data['MSSubClass'].fillna("None")


# Is there any remaining missing value ? 

# In[ ]:


#Check remaining missing values if any 
all_data_na = (all_data.isnull().sum() / len(all_data)) * 100
all_data_na = all_data_na.drop(all_data_na[all_data_na == 0].index).sort_values(ascending=False)

    all_data[c] = lbl.transform(list(all_data[c].values))

# shape        
print('Shape all_data: {}'.format(all_data.shape))



# **Adding one more important feature**

# Since area related features are very important to determine house prices, we add one more feature which is the total area of basement, first and second floor areas of each house

# In[ ]:


# Adding total sqfootage feature 
all_data['TotalSF'] = all_data['TotalBsmtSF'] + all_data['1stFlrSF'] + all_data['2ndFlrSF']


# **Skewed features**

# **Box Cox Transformation of (highly) skewed features**

# We use the scipy  function boxcox1p which computes the Box-Cox transformation of **\\(1 + x\\)**. 
# 
# Note that setting \\( \lambda = 0 \\) is equivalent to log1p used above for the target variable.

# ##Stacking  models

# ###Simplest Stacking approach : Averaging base models

# We begin with this simple approach of averaging base models.  We build a new **class**  to extend scikit-learn with our model and also to laverage encapsulation and code reuse ([inheritance][1]) 
# 
# 
#   [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)

# **Averaged base models class**

# In[ ]:


class AveragingModels(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin, TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, models):
        self.models = models
        
    # we define clones of the original models to fit the data in
    def fit(self, X, y):
        self.models_ = [clone(x) for x in self.models]
        
        # Train cloned base models
        for model in self.models_:
            model.fit(X, y)

        return self
    
    #Now we do the predictions for cloned models and average them
    def predict(self, X):
        predictions = np.column_stack([
            model.predict(X) for model in self.models_
        ])
        return np.mean(predictions, axis=1)   


# **Averaged base models score**

# We just average four models here **ENet, GBoost,  KRR and lasso**.  Of course we could easily add more models in the mix. 

# In[ ]:


averaged_models = AveragingModels(models = (ENet, GBoost, KRR, lasso))

score = rmsle_cv(averaged_models)
print(" Averaged base models score: {:.4f} ({:.4f})\n".format(score.mean(), score.std()))


# Wow ! It seems even the simplest stacking approach really improve the score . This encourages 
# us to go further and explore a less simple stacking approch. 

# ###Less simple Stacking : Adding a Meta-model

# In this approach, we add a meta-model on averaged base models and use the out-of-folds predictions of these base models to train our meta-model. 
# 
# The procedure, for the training part, may be described as follows:
# 
# 
# 1. Split the total training set into two disjoint sets (here **train** and .**holdout** )
# 
# 2. Train several base models on the first part (**train**)
# 
# 3. Test these base models on the second part (**holdout**)
# 
# 4. Use the predictions from 3)  (called  out-of-folds predictions) as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs  to train a higher level learner called **meta-model**.
# 
# The first three steps are done iteratively . If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration,  we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold). 
# 
# So, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as 
# new feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.
# 
# For the prediction part , We average the predictions of  all base models on the test data  and used them as **meta-features**  on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.

# On this gif, the base models are algorithms 0, 1, 2 and the meta-model is algorithm 3. The entire training dataset is 
# A+B (target variable y known) that we can split into train part (A) and holdout part (B). And the test dataset is C. 
# 
# B1 (which is the prediction from the holdout part)  is the new feature used to train the meta-model 3 and C1 (which
# is the prediction  from the test dataset) is the meta-feature on which the final prediction is done.
