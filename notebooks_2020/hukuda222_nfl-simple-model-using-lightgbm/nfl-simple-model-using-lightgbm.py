# ## evaluation
# Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) is derived based on the predicted scalar value.

# $$

# $$
# $H(x)=1$ if $x\geq 0$ else $0$

# The organizers seemed to expect to predict one by one, so I did. 
# However, it seems that it is likely to be faster to predict at once after all the evaluation data is acquired by dummy input.
# 
# 
# This model is a simple one that has not been tuned, so I think we can still expect a better score.
# Please let me know if you have any opinions or advice.
