# **Update**
# 
# 2018/08/27
# - Corrected error in calculating min/max coordinates. This error has no consequence for the remaining analysis. [Thanks to Pegah]
# 
# 2018/08/10
# - Added visuals to analyse the importance of the direction of a trip
# 
# 2018/08/08
# - Using the insights from this notebook, I trained a model that got a #1 position on 2018/08/07 (LB score 2.88396)
# - Added pickup traffic density plots to see how busy it is in Manhatten by the hour
# 
# 2018/08/04
# - Thanks for all the feedback! This notebook is becoming rather long, but there is so much fun stuff to analyse!! ;)
# - updated the boundingbox and NYC maps, as one test point was not within the bounding box
# - added zoomed in map of NYC
# - added hiresolution NYC/Manhattan map plot
# - added function to remove datapoints from water
# - small update in datapoints per sq miles calculation
# 
# 2018/07/30
# - Corrected 'ewr'/'lgr' typo [Thanks to Lu Mingming]
# - Small update `plot_on_map` function
# - Converted distances to miles [Thanks to sandy1112]
# - Add Taxi pricing rules [Thanks to sandy1112]
# - Added density plots (datapoints per sq mile)
# 
# 2018/07/28 
# - Added a graph with estimated drive time for two trips using Google Map Traffic info. This could explain how fare depends on hour of the day.

# ## Reading data and first exploration
# 
# 
# First thing I like to do with a new dataset is to explore the data. This means investigating the number of features, their datatype, their meaning and statistics.

# In[ ]:


# load some default Python modules
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')


# As this dataset is huge reading all data would require a lot of memory. Therefore I read a limited number of rows while exploring the data. When my exploration code (e.g. this notebook) is ready I re-run the notebook while reading more rows.

# In[ ]:


# read data in pandas dataframe
df_train =  pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv', nrows = 2_000_000, parse_dates=["pickup_datetime"])

# list first few rows (datapoints)
df_train.head()


# In[ ]:


# check datatypes
df_train.dtypes


# In[ ]:


# check statistics of the features
df_train.describe()


# The following things I notice (while using 500k datapoints):
# 
# - The minimal `fare_amount` is negative. As this does not seem to be realistic I will drop them from the dataset.
# - Some of the minimum and maximum longitude/lattitude coordinates are way off. These I will also remove from the dataset (I will define a bounding box for the coordinates, see further).
# - The average `fare_amount` is about \$11.4 USD with a standard deviation of \$9.9 USD. When building a predictive model we want to be better than $9.9 USD :)

# In[ ]:


print('Old size: %d' % len(df_train))
df_train = df_train[df_train.fare_amount>=0]
print('New size: %d' % len(df_train))


# In[ ]:


# plot histogram of fare
df_train[df_train.fare_amount<100].fare_amount.hist(bins=100, figsize=(14,3))
plt.xlabel('fare $USD')
plt.title('Histogram');


# In the histogram of the `fare_amount` there are some small spikes between \$40 and \$60. This could indicate some fixed fare price (e.g. to/from airport). This will be explored further below.

# ## Remove missing data
# 
# Always check to see if there is missing data. As this dataset is huge, removing datapoints with missing data probably has no effect on the models beings trained.

# In[ ]:


print(df_train.isnull().sum())


# In[ ]:


print('Old size: %d' % len(df_train))
df_train = df_train.dropna(how = 'any', axis = 'rows')
print('New size: %d' % len(df_train))


# ## Test data
# Read the test data to check the statistics and compare with the training set.

# In[ ]:


# read data in pandas dataframe

df_test.head(5)

# ## Location data
# 
# As we're dealing with location data, I want to plot the coordinates on a map. This gives a better view of the data. For this, I use the following website:
# 
# - Easy to use map and GPS tool: https://www.gps-coordinates.net/ 
# - Calculate distance between locations: https://www.travelmath.com/flying-distance/
# - Open street map to grab using bouding box a map: https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=8/52.154/5.295
# 
# New York city coordinates are (https://www.travelmath.com/cities/New+York,+NY):
# 
# - longitude = -74.0063889
# - lattitude = 40.7141667
# 
# I define a bounding box of interest by [long_min, long_max, latt_min, latt_max] using the minimum and maximum coordinates from the testset. This way, I'm sure to train a model for the full pickup/dropoff coordinate range of the test set.
# 
# From Open Street Map I grab a map and I drop any datapoint outside this box.

# ## Removing datapoints in water
# As can be seen from the map + scatter plots above, some datapoints are located in the water. These are obviously noisy datapoints. To remove these datapoints, I create a boolean land/water map from the NYC map. For this I used Photoshop to threshold on the blue color of the water and to cleanup the map. The resulting map is show below.

# In[ ]:


# read nyc mask and turn into boolean map with
# land = True, water = False

plt.imshow(nyc_map, zorder=0)
plt.imshow(nyc_mask, zorder=1, alpha=0.7); # note: True is show in black, False in white.


# Next, I need to convert longitude/latitude coordinates to xy pixel coordinates. The function lonlat_to_xy implements this transformation. Note that the y coordinate needs to be reversed as the image y-axis is directed from top to bottom.
# 
# Once for all datapoints the xy pixel coordinates are calculate a boolean index is calculated using the NYC mask.

# In[ ]:


# translate longitude/latitude coordinate into image xy coordinate

# ### Datapoint density per sq mile
# 
# 
# A scatterplot of the pickup and dropoff locations gives a quick impression of the density. However, it is more accurate to count the number of datapoints per area to visualize the density. The code below counts pickup and dropoff datapoints per sq miles. This gives a better view on the 'hot spots'.

# For this plot and further analysis, we need a function to calculate the distance in miles between locations in lon,lat coordinates.

# ## Distance and time visualisations
# 
# Before building a model I want to test some basic 'intuition':
# 
# - The longer the distance between pickup and dropoff location, the higher the fare.
# - Some trips, like to/from an airport, are fixed fee. 
# - Fare at night is different from day time.
# 
# So, let's check.

# ### The longer the distance between pickup and dropoff location, the higher the fare
# 
# To visualize the distance - fare relation we need to calculate the distance of a trip first.

# add new column to dataframe with distance in miles

# From this plot we notice:
# 
# - There are trips with zero distance but with a non-zero fare. Could this be trips from and to the same location? Predicting these fares will be difficult as there is likely not sufficient information in the dataset.
# - There are some trips with >50 miles travel distance but low fare. Perhaps these are discounted trips? Or the previously mentioned hotspot near Seymour (see density plots above)?
# - The horizontal lines in the right plot might indicate again the fixed fare trips to/from JFK airport.
# - Overall there seems to be a (linear) relation between distance and fare with an average rate of +/- 100/20 = 5 \$USD/mile.
# 
# Considering the last point, when I google for NYC taxi fare prices I find:
# 
# - \$4.00 – \$10.00 for 3km trip (https://www.priceoftravel.com/555/world-taxi-prices-what-a-3-kilometer-ride-costs-in-72-big-cities/)
# - Start range: \$2.50 - \$3.30, 1km range: \$1.55 - \$2.98 (https://www.numbeo.com/taxi-fare/in/New-York)
# - A detailed description of the taxi prices: http://home.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml
#     - Initial charge for most rides (excluding from JFK and other airports) is \$2.50 upon entry. After that there \$0.5 every unit where the unit is defined as 1/5th of a mile or when the Taxicab is travelling 12 Miles an hour or more...since we can't decipher the velocity of the car, I would take 1/5th of a mile as the unit and convert the distance into this unit.
#     - \$0.5 of additional surcharge between 8PM - 6AM.
#     - Peak hour weekday surcharge of \$1 Monday-Friday between 4PM-8PM.
#     - There is a \$0.5 MTA State Surcharge for all trips that end in New York City or Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange or Putnam Counties.
#     - There is a \$0.3 Improvement surcharge
# 
# Note: the calculated distance in the dataset is from point to point. In reality, the distance measured by road is larger.

# The maximum fare \$USD/mile seem to be very high. This could be due to wrong distance or fare data. On the other hand, let's analyse this somewhat further. In general taxi fare is calculate by
# 
# $$
# y_{fare} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x_{distance} + \theta_2 \cdot x_{duration}
# $$
# 
# with $\theta_0$ the starting tariff, $x_{distance}$ the distance travelled and $x_{duration}$ the duration of the trip. If we rewrite this we get an expression for the fare per distance:
# 
# $$
# \frac{y_{fare}}{x_{distance}} = \frac{\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \theta_1 + \theta_2 \cdot \frac{x_{duration}}{ x_{distance}}
# $$
# 
# Let's further assume for the shorter trips that $x_{distance} = c \cdot x_{duration}$ with $c$ the average speed, then we get
# 
# $$
# \frac{y_{fare}}{x_{distance}} = \frac{\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \theta_1 + \frac{\theta_2}{c} \cdot \frac{x_{duration}}{x_{duration}} = \frac{\theta_0}{x_{distance}} + \theta_1'
# $$
# 
# with $\theta_1' = \theta_1 + \theta_2 / c$.
# 
# Conclusion: the fare per distance is proportional to $1/\text{distance_mile}$. Let's plot the data and a graph.

# Note that the fare per distance has more spread for smaller distances (<0.5 mile) than larger distances. This could be explained as follows:  we measure the distance from point to point and not by road. For smaller distances the difference between these two measurement methods is expected to be larger. This is one aspect I would guess a more advanced model (deep learning NN) would improve upon compared to a linear model.
# 
# [30/07/2018] An other reason why the spread for smaller distances is larger could be due to slow traffic at rush hours. Short drives at rush hours vary more in duration.

# Let's continue with the time vs fare per distance analysis. Next we use a pandas pivot table to calculate a summary and to plot them.

# It can be clearly seen that the fare $USD/mile varies over the years and over the hours.

# To investigate this further I used Google map to calculate the expected duration of two trips:
# 
# - Trip 1 : from Museum of the City of New York to Beacon Theatre, 4.5km, not leaving Manhatten
# - Trip 2 : from Times Squared to Maria Hermandez Park, 12km, leaving Times Squared via Queens Midtown Tunnel (Toll road)

plt.xlabel('direction (degrees)')
plt.xticks(range(36), np.arange(-170, 190, 10))
plt.ylabel('average fare amount $USD');


# Now, clear the average fare amount in Manhattan depends on the direction. This is not too surprisingly, as the streets in Manhattan have a angle of about 60 degrees with the horizon. In the 60 degrees direction Manhatten is longer than in the direction perpendicular to this (-30 degrees). To investigate the influence of the direction to the fare amount further we should consider trips with the some length. See below.

# In[ ]:


# select trips in Manhattan with +/- 2 miles distance drive
idx2 = idx_manhattan & (df_train.distance_miles>1.5) & (df_train.distance_miles<1.7)

# plot direction vs average fare amount

plt.xlabel('direction (degrees)')
plt.xticks(range(36), np.arange(-170, 190, 10))
plt.ylabel('average fare amount $USD');


# So, even for trips with the same length we see the influence of the direction on the fare amount. The notebook of Oliver (https://www.kaggle.com/ojones3/feature-engineering-corrected-manhattan-distance) explains the difference in calculating the distance of a trip using Euclidean vs Manhattan distance measure. The distance calculated in this notebook is the direct point-to-point distance. This is not the true distance of the trip. Using the Manhattan distance gives a better approximation *if* the streets are aligned to the vertical and horizontal axis. That is, if we turn the streets 60 degrees. 
# 
# This is the reason that the average fare for direction=60 or -120 is the lowest, as the distance at these angles is the true distance (driving down a street without turns). If the direction is different from 60 or -120 degrees, this means that the distance of the trip in reality is larger, so a higher fare amount.

# This model gives a kaggle score of about 5. Certainly not the best model on the leaderboard, but what could we expect from a linear regression model? 
# 
# From now on we need to improve the model. Considering the analysis above, I would search for a model that is able to:
# 
# - model the non-linear time (`hour`) dependency
# - model different pricings (e.g. fixed fee to an airport vs metered ride)
# - model location dependencies and avoid the direct point-to-point distance measure.
