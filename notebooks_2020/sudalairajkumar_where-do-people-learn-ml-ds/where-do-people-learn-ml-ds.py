# ## Introduction
# In the recent times, Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer has become one of the most sought after profession. Even HBR regarded Data Scientist as the 'sexiest job of the 21st century'.
# 
# 

# ![Data Scientist ](https://datastoriesthailand.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot-2015-02-02-21-18-24.png)

# So there is a lot of interest among people to learn about Data Science. Also Data science is a multi-disciplinary domain which requires knowledge of multiple subjects. The following picture will give an idea. 

# ![DS_Subjects](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tMm8qCW59DCK7G0hb-HevQ.png)

# Given this situation, one main question that comes to people's mind is that where can I learn about DS and ML. An answer to this question will be very helpful for people to get started in this field. So in this notebook, let us explore the different options where people learn about DS / ML skills. 
# 
# **Most of the plots are interactive. So please feel free to hover over the plots, zoom in / out, rotate them as needed**
# 
# Firstly, I would like to thank Kaggle for conducting this DS / ML survey again this year and making the data available for people like us to use.

# ## Learning Category:
# 
# In this intial phase of the analysis, let us take up question 35 in the survey. The question is:
# 
# *What percentage of your machine learning/ data science training falls under each category?*
# 
# The choices given for this question are
#  1. Self-taught 
#  2. Online courses like Coursera, Udemy, edX etc
#  3. Work
#  4. University
#  5. Kaggle Competiitons
#  6. Other - Free text field
#  
# We need to give a percentage value for each of these learning categories and the total should sum up to 100%.
# 
# Overall there are 23,858 responses in this survey and let us check the number of respondents for each of these training categories (percentage of the category is greater than 0).

# **Observations:**
#  * There are some missing values for this question and after dropping them we have 15,745 responses in total.
#  * 'Self taught is the category with most number of respondents having percentage of learning greater than 0.
#  * With the recent explosion of MOOC courses, 'Online courses' come in second 
#  * Learning as part of work is third and traditional way of learning - 'University' is fourth
#  * Though Kaggle competitions take the fifth spot, the number of respondents is not much lesser than third and forth place.
#  
#  
#  ### Percentage Contribution of Learning Categories:
#  
#  Now let us see, how much percentage each of the learning categories contribute to the learning process.

#  * Only less than half of the respondents have the percentage share of 'University' as greater than 0

#  ### Distribution of DS / ML Learning Category at different Countries:

# **Observations:**
#  * Compared to other top countries, the percentage contribution of universities in USA is much higher. I think this might be because there are multiple universities in US offering courses in DS / ML when compared with other countries.
#  * In countries like India, Russia & Japan, the role of universities in Learning DS / ML is much lesser compared to other categories. 
#  * Also if we look at **Asian countries** in the list (India, China, Russia and Japan), **median percentage of Kaggle contribution** for learning DS / ML is greater than 0 while it is zero for other countries. 
#  * Contribution from learning at Work is more in Russia, France and Japan
#  * In Brazil, the contribution of MOOC courses seem to be more than other learning categories
#  * I personally think these plots directly represent the comfortable ways to acquire knowledge at these corresponding regions.

# **Observations:**
#  
#  * As expected, University plays a major role in imparting DS / ML knowledge among students and 'Work' has the least contribution
#  * In case of Data Scientist, most of the respondents have mentioned that 'Work' plays a major role in learning the concepts. Self-learning also plays an equally important role.
#  * For 'Software Enginner' who are learning DS / ML, 'Self-taught' and 'Online courses' are the ways to acquire knowledge compared to other means.
#  * Also respondents with title 'Software Engineer' mentioned that Kaggle competitions share a higher percentage in learning DS / ML compared to other professions (looking at the third quartile)

#  * Median contribution of 'University' as learning category is high for people less than 30 years of age
#  * Contribution of Kaggle as a learning category is fairly consistent across age groups with a slght higher third quartile for people aged less than 21. Looks like Kaggle is quite popular with the younger bunch ;)

# ### Online Courses Vs Brick & Mortar

# ## Coursera Data Science Courses Review Dataset
# 
# Now that we got an idea about the perception of people about online courses, let us check the perception from some other place. Thankfully we also have a [coursera course review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/septa97/100k-courseras-course-reviews-dataset#reviews_by_course.csv) in Kaggle datasets. So in this section let us use this dataset to make some plots and see if they also give similar results.

# In[ ]:


coursera_df = pd.read_csv("../input/100k-courseras-course-reviews-dataset/reviews_by_course.csv")
courses = ["machine-learning", "python-data", "r-programming", "data-scientists-tools", "ml-foundations", "python-data-analysis"]

# **Observations:**
#  * Looks like the "machine learning" course in coursera is one of the widely popular courses and it has the highest number of reviews
#  * "python-data" is the second one with most number of reviews followed by "data-scientist-tools"

)

data = [trace5, trace4, trace3, trace2, trace1]
fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)
iplot(fig, filename="CourseraReviews")


# **Observations:**
#  * Machine Learning in coursera is not just the most popular course by count, it is the course with most percentage of "very positive" reviews as well. I think this is one of the very popular starting courses for people wanting to learn DS / ML
#  * Overall, the positive reviews are higher than the negative reviews for all the courses and is inline with Kaggle survey results as well. 
#  * Now you know which course to start first ;)

# ## In-person Bootcamps
# 
# Apart from online courses, one another recent addition that has gained popularity to learn data science is in-person bootcamps. More information about the bootcamps can be seen [here](https://www.cio.com/article/3051124/careers-staffing/10-boot-camps-to-kick-start-your-data-science-career.html) and [here](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-data-science-bootcamps).

# **Observations:**
#  * Seems like a good part of the respondents are not aware of the bootcamps. About 33% of the people took a "No opinion / I do not know" stance
#  * About 39.5% of the people feel that they are better than traditional institutions
#  * About 18.8% of the respondents are neutral on their views

#  ## Media Sources for Data Science

#  There are quite a few media sources available for us to keep a tab on the happenings in Data Science space. In this section, let us explore the data science media sources.

# **Observations:**
#  * ods.ai seem to be one another popular media source 
#  * We could also see some social media channels like linkedin, facebook, youtube, quora etc
#  * Being from India, I could also see Analytics Vidhya mentioned in few places ( which means it needs some better cleaning ;) )
