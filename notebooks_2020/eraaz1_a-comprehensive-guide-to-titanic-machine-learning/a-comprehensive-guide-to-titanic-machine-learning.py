# # About this Kernel
# This kernel may (or may not) be helpful in your long and often tedious machine learning journey. Sometimes you may find this notebook verbose and overwhelming particularly if you're a beginner. This verbosity tries to explain everything I could possibly know. Once you get through the notebook, you could expect to have a good grasp of the fundamentals. I've also tried to write reusable codes as much as possible using custom functions so that we can avoid writing the same code again and again. Let's get started.

# # 1.Problem Description and Objective <a id="1"></a>
# The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most notorious shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crews. This harrowing tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
# 
# In this problem, we're asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of passengers were likely to survive the tragedy using machine learning. So its our job to predict if a passenger survived from the sinking Titanic or not with the help of machine learning. So its a binary classification problem.

# ### So what can we see??
# **We can see total 12 variables. And each variable has 1309 observations (excluding Survived).**
# ### Here comes the description of all variables:
# 1. **PassengerId** is a unique identifying number assigned to each passenger.
# 2. **Survived** is a flag that indicates if a passenger survived or died ( i.e., 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
# 3. **Pclass** is the passenger class (i.e., 1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class).
# 4. **Name** is the name of the passenger.
# 5. **Sex** indicates the gender of the passenger (i.e., Male or female).
# 6. **Age** indicates the age of the passenger.
# 7. **Sibsp**  is the number of siblings/spouses aboard.
# 8. **Parch** is the number of parents/children aboard.
# 9. **Ticket** indicates the ticket number issued to the passenger.
# 10. **Fare** indicates the amount of money spent on their ticket.
# 11. **Cabin** indicates the cabin category occupied by the passenger.
# 12. **Embarked** indicates the port where the passenger embarked from (i.e., C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
# 
# 
# ### Here, Survived is the target variable and rest of the variables are predictor variables.
# 
# ## 3.2 Categorical and Numerical Variables  <a id="3.2"></a>
# **Categorical Variable:** Survived, Sex, Pclass (ordinal), Embarked, Cabin, Name, Ticket, SibSp, and Parch.

# 2. **float data type variables:** Fare and Age, *Survived (due to concatenation)*
# 3. **object (numbers + strings) data type variables:** Name, Sex, Ticket, Cabin, and Embarked.
# 
# # 4.Univariate Analysis <a id="4"></a>
# Univariate analysis separately explores the distribution of each variable in a data set. It looks at the range of values, as well as the central tendency of the values. Univariate data analysis does not look at relationships between various variables (like bivariate and multivariate analysis) rather it summarises each variable on its own. Methods to perform univariate analysis will depend on whether the variable is categorical or numerical. For numerical variable, we would explore its shape of distribution (distribution can either be symmetric or skewed) using histogram and density plots. For categorical variables, we would use bar plots to visualize the absolute and proportional frequency distribution. Knowing the distribution of the feature values becomes important when you use machine learning methods that assume a particular type of it, most often Gaussian. **Let's starts off with categorical variables:**
# 
# ## 4.1 Categorical Variables  <a id="4.1"></a>

# ###  4.1.1 Survived <a id="4.1.1"></a>

# In[ ]:


"""Plot number of survivors and victims in absolute and relative scale in the tragedy."""
plotFrequency(merged.Survived)


# **Findings:** Variable Survived is imbalanced since the proportion of survivors and victims is not equally represented in its distribution. Out of 891 passengers, only 342 passengers survived and a whopping 549 passengers died. Or put another way, 61.62% passengers died while just 38.38% of passengers were lucky enough to survive.

# ### 4.1.2 Sex <a id="4.1.2"></a>

# In[ ]:


"""Plot the absolute and relative frequency of Sex."""
plotFrequency(merged.Sex)


# **Findings:** Variable Sex is imbalanced as proportion of male vs female in its distribution are not equally represented. Rather Male(843) has outnumbered female (466) in variable Sex. Or, proportionally, over 64% of Sex variable consists of label male while female contibutes to only over 35.5% of Sex.
# 
# ### 4.1.3 Pclass  <a id="4.1.3"></a>

# In[ ]:


"""Absolute and relative frequency of Pclass."""
plotFrequency(merged.Pclass)


# **Findings:** Again class distribution of Pclass is imbalanced as three categories of Pclass are not evenly represented in its distribution. 3 (Pclass3) is the most occured (709) levels of Pclass while 2 is the least occured (277). Another way of saying that, over  54% of Pclass variable consists of 3(Pclass3) while 1 and 2 both combinedly contribute to nearly 46% of Pclass.
# 
# ### 4.1.4 Embarked  <a id="4.1.4"></a>

# In[ ]:


"""Plot absolute and relative frequency of Embarked."""
plotFrequency(merged.Embarked)


# **Findings:** Embarked is also imbalanced since its levels are not equally represented in its distribution. A whopping 914 passengers embarked from Southamton while just 123 embarked from Queenstown. In other words, almost 70% of Embarked consists of S while both C and Q contribute to 30 to Embarked.

# In[ ]:


"""Finally preview the variable Cabin to see what is causing the irregularity."""

# **Findings:** Looks like Cabin is an alphanumeric type variable with 1014 missing obsevations. There are 187 kinds of categories in variable Cabin. Since there are too many categories in Cabin, we must process (i.e., reduce the number of categories) Cabin to check if there is any association between Survived and Cabin.

# ### 4.1.8 SibSp  <a id="4.1.8"></a>

# In[ ]:


"""Plot the absolute and relative frequency of SibSp to investigate its distribution."""
plotFrequency(merged.SibSp)


# **Findings:** Once again, SibSp is not balanced as levels of SibSp(7) are not equally represented in its distribution. 891 passengers were without siblings or spouses. Put another way, over 68% passengers had no siblings or spouses aboard, followed by over 24% passengers had 1 siblings or spouse.
# 
# ### 4.1.9 Parch  <a id="4.1.9"></a>

# In[ ]:


"""Absolute and relative frequency of Parch."""

# **Findings:** Parch isn't balanced as levels of Parch(8) are not equally represented in its distribution. Over one thousand passengers were without parents or children, followed by 170 passengers had one parents or children. In other words, over 76.5% passengers were without parents or children while rest of the 23.5% had few parents or children.
# 
# ## 4.2 Numerical Variables <a id="4.2"></a>
# We would like to analyse numerical variables using histogram, density plot, and summary statistics. To analyse numerical variables, we will create 2 custom functions.

# ### 4.2.1 Fare <a id="4.2.1"></a>

# In[ ]:


'''Plot histogram and density plot of Fare.'''
plotHistogram(merged.Fare)


# **Reading the histogram, it's clear that Fare's distribution has a high positive skewness. And it seems a number of passengers (653) paid for fare between 5 to 15 (less than 15), followed by 25 to 35 (less than 35).**
# 
# There is also another, often clearer, way to grasp the distribution: density plots or, more formally, Kernel Density Plots. They can be considered a smoothed version of the histogram. One advantage of density plot over histogram is that its shape of distribution isn't affected by the number of bins used.

# In[ ]:


"""Calculate summary statistics of Fare."""
bold("Summary Stats of Fare:")
calculateSummaryStats(merged.Fare)


# **So what does the  value of skewness suggest?**
# 1. If skewness is less than −1 or greater than +1, the distribution can be considered as highly skewed.
# 2. If skewness is between −1 and −½ or between +½ and +1, the distribution can be considered as moderately skewed.
# 3. And finally if skewness is between −½ and +½, the distribution can be considered as approximately symmetric.    
# 
# **Findings:** Density plot shows the mass of the distribution of Fare is heavily concentrated on the left of the figure due to very long tail on the right side. So it can be said that Fare is substantially skewed(positively) that is also supported by the calculated positive value of skewness of 4.37

# **At first glance, Age seems to be positively skewed (slightly). 344 passengers' age is between 20 to 30(less than 30). And passengers between age 70 to 80(including 80) was 8 were the least.**

# **Findings:** What we can see from the density plot is that the mass of the distribution of Age is slightly concentrated on the left of the figure due to comparatively long tail on the right side. So it can be said that Age is almost normally distributed since the tail on the both sides are almost equal and it has a small value of positive skewness of 0.41 (in between -0.5 to 0.5). So it can be said that Age is almost normally distributed.

# 
# Another useful plot for visualizing a continuous variable is box plot. Box plot is particularly helpful to understand the spread of the continus data and whether there are potential unusual observations (outliers) in that variable. It presents information of min, 1st quartile, 2nd quartile(median), 3rd quartile, and max of a variable.**We will use IQR method to detect the outliers for variable Age and Fare though we won't remove them.**

# # 7.Imputing Missing Variables <a id="7"></a>
# The simpliest way to impute missing values of a variable is to impute its missing values with its mean, median or mode depending on its distribution and variable type(categorical or numerical). By now, we should have a good idea about the distribution of the variables and the presence of outliers in those variables. For categorical variables mode-imputation is performed and for numerical variable mean-impuation is performed if its distribution is symmetric(or almost symmetric or normal like Age). On the other hand, for a variable with skewed distribution and outliers (like Fare), meadian-imputation is recommended as median is more immune to outliers than mean. 
# 
# However, one clear disadvantage of using mean, median or mode to impute missing values is the addition of bias if the amount of missing values is significant (like Age). So simply replacing them with the mean or the median age might not be the best solution since the age may differ by groups and categories of passengers.
# 
# To solve this, we can group our data by some variables that have no missing values and for each subset compute the median age to impute the missing values. Or we can build a linear regression model that will predict missing values of Age using the features that have no missing values. These two methods may result in better accuracy without high bias, unless a missing value is expected to have a very high variance. We will show the former method of imputation.

# Being the most important part, bivariate analysis tries to find the relationship between two variables. We will look for correlation or association between our predictor and target variables. Bivariate analysis is performed for any combination of categorical and numerical variables. The combination can be: Numerical & Numerical, Numerical & Categorical and Categorical & Categorical. Different methods are used to tackle these combinations during analysis process. The methods are:
# 1. Numerical & Numerical: Pearson's correlation, or Spearman correlation (the later doesn't require normal distribution).
# 2. Numerical & Categorical: Point biserial correlation (only  if categorical variable is binary type), or ANOVA test. For this problem, you can use either biserial correlation or ANOVA. But I will perform both test just to learn because ANOVA will come in handy if categorical variable has more than two classes.
# 3. Categorical & Categorical: We would use Chi-square test for bivariate analysis between categorical variables.

# 
# Though one should use either point biserial correlation (if categorical variable is of binary type) or ANOVA method for this problem to find any association between a categorical and a numerical variable, I would perform ANOVA too to have an intuition of how ANOVA works. Though ANOVA is usually prefered if the categorical variable having more than two groups, it is also possible to perform ANOVA for a categorical variable with two groups.
# 
# The one-way ANOVA tests whether the mean of some numeric variable differs across the levels of one categorical variable. It essentially answers the question: do any of the group means differ from one another? The null hypothesis is all of the group means are equal.

calculateAnova(df_train.Fare)


# **Interpretation of ANOVA result:**
# As p < 0.05 we state that we have a main interaction effect. This simply means that amongst the groups at least any of the group(or groups) means statistically significantly  differ from one another (true for only more than two groups). However, this result does not identify the sample pair (or pairs) which cause this significance (again true for more than two groups of categorical variable but we have just two groups..i.e., 0 and 1).
# So, when ANOVA reports 'interaction effect' we need to further identify the group pairs by applying pair-wise controls(required for more than two groups of categorical variable). Although these controls could be done by implementing ordinary t-test but this is not the right approach. So a post hoc-test ( usually Tukey's test) is performed to find the pair or pairs that cause the difference. Though Tukey's test is not required with a categorical variable less than three groups.
# 
# ***Note:*** Tukey's test is not required if ANOVA gives a p value greater than 0.05 and nominal variable has less than three groups.

# 
# ***Chi-square Test***: The Chi-square test of independence tests if there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables.The data is usually displayed in a cross-tabulation format with each row representing a category for one variable and each column representing a category for another variable. Chi-square test of independence is an omnibus test.That is it tests the data as a whole. This means that one will not be able to tell which levels (categories) of the variables are responsible for the relationship **if the Chi-square table is larger than 2×2. If the test is larger than 2×2, it requires post hoc testing.**
# 
# **The H0 (Null Hypothesis): There is no relationship between variable 1 and variable 2.**
# 
# **The H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): There is a relationship between variable 1 and variable 2.**
# 
# If the p-value is significant (less than 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis and claim that the findings support the alternate hypothesis. While we check the results of the chi2 test, we need also to check that the expected cell frequencies are greater than or equal to 5. If a cell has an expected frequency less that 5, then the Fisher’s Exact test should be use to overcome this problem.

Since all of the expected frequencies are greater than 5, the chi2 test results can be trusted. We can reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is less than 0.05(infact p value is almost 0).

# **Looks like all the tree based models have highest train accuracy followed KNN, LR, ABC and SVC. But train accuracy of a model is not enough to tell if a model can be able to generalize the unseen data or not. Because training data is something our model has been trained with, i.e., data our model has already seen it. We all know that, the purpose of building a machine learning model is to generalize the unseen data, i.e., data our model has not yet seen. Hence we can't use training accuracy for our model evaluation rather we must know how our model will perform on the data our model is yet to see.**
# 
# ## 11.2 Model Evaluation <a id="11.2"></a>
# So basically, to evaluate a model's performance, we need some data (input) for which we know the ground truth(label). For this problem, we don't know the ground truth for the test set but we do know for the train set. So the idea is to train and evaluate the model performance on different data. One thing we can do is to split the train set in two groups, usually in 80:20 ratio. That means we would train our model on 80% of the training data and we reserve the rest 20% for evaluating the model since we know the ground truth for this 20% data. Then we can compare our model prediction with this ground truth (for 20% data). That's how we can tell how our model would perform on unseen data. This is the first model evaluation technique. In sklearn we have a train_test_split method for that.
# 
# Train_test split has its drawbacks. Because this approach introduces bias as we are not using all of our observations for testing and also we're  reducing the train data size. To overcome this we can use a technique called cross validation where all the data is used for training and testing periodically. Thus we may reduce the bias introduced by train_test_split. From different cross validation methods, we would use k-fold cross validation. In sklearn we have a method cross_val_score for calculating k-fold cross validation score.
# 
# However,  as the train set gets larger, train_test_split has its advantage over k-fold cross validation. Train_test_split is k-times faster than k-fold cross validation. If the training set is very large, both train_test_split and k-fold cross validation perform identically. So for a large training data, train_test_split is prefered over k-fold cross validation to accelerate the training process.
# 
# ### 11.2.1 K-Fold Cross Validation <a id="11.2.1"></a>
# Let's say we will use 10-fold cross validation. So k = 10 and we have total 891 observations. Each fold would have 891/10 = 89.1 observations. So basically k-fold cross validation uses fold-1 (89.1 samples) as the testing set and k-1 (9 folds) as the training sets and calculates test accuracy.This procedure is repeated k times (if k = 10, then 10 times); each time, a different group of observations is treated as a validation or test set. This process results in k estimates of the test accuracy which are then averaged out.

These are the tree based models that have 'feature_importances_' method by default. LR, KNN and SVC don't have this method. In this problem, SVC uses rbf kernel (only possible for linear kernel to plot feature importance), so its not possible to view feature importance given by SVC.

# # 12.More Evaluation Metrics  <a id="12"></a>
# We've so far used accuracy score to evaluate our classifiers. But sometimes accuracy score isn't all enough to evaluate a classifier properly as accuracy score doesn't tell exactly which class (positive or negative) is being wrongly classified by our classifier in case of low accuracy score. **Again for imbalanced classification problem, accuracy score isn't the best metric to choose between different classifiers. To clarify this, in this section, we will calculate confusion matrix, precision score, recall score, specificity, f1 score, classification report for both random forest and gradient boosting classifier. And then we will compare our two best classifiers (rf and gbc) using these calculated metrics to see exactly where one classifier excels the other.**
# 
# ## 12.1 Confusion Matrix  <a id="12.1"></a>
# The confusion matrix shows the number of correct classifications along with misclassifications when a classifier make predictions for each class (positive or negative). The diagonal elements are correct classification while the off diagonal elements are misscalssifications. Some basic terms associated with confusion matrix:
# 1. True positives (TP): These are cases in which we predicted 1(yes), and the actual is also 1(yes).
# 2. True negatives (TN): We predicted 0(no), and the actual is also 0(no).
# 3. False positives (FP): We predicted 1(yes), but the actual is 0(no). (Also known as a "Type I error.")
# 4. False negatives (FN): We predicted 0(no), but the actual is 1(yes). (Also known as a "Type II error.")

# This two plots tells few different things:
# 
# 1. A model that predicts at chance will have an ROC curve that looks like the diagonal red line. That is not a discriminating model.
# 
# 2. The further the curve is off the diagonal red line, the better the model is at discriminating between positives and negatives in general.
# 
# 3. There are useful statistics that can be calculated from this curve, like the Area Under the Curve (AUC). This tells you how well the model predicts and the optimal cut point for any given model (under specific circumstances).
# 
# **Comparing the two ROC curves, we can see the distance between blue and red line of RF is greater than the distance between blue and red line of GBC. Hence it can safely be said that RF, in general, is better at discriminating between positives and negatives than GBC. Also RF(92.11%) auc score (which is the area under the roc curve) is greater than gbc(91.94%). It seems the higher the area, the further the classifier is off the red diagonal line and vice versa and hence more accurate. Since RF has more area under the ROC curve than GBC, RF is more accurate.**

The fact that gbc's accuracy on the holdout data is 0.78468 compared with the 0.8406 accuracy we got with cross-validation indicates that GBC underfits the training data that we obsetved from the learning curve (see part 11.7). Hence it performs poorly on kaggle hold out set compared to RF.**
# 
# ### Can we further improve our classifiers' accuracy? May be we can! In the next few section, we will try to improve our models' accuracy with the help of ensemble method.

# # 14.Introduction to Ensemble <a id="14"></a>
# Can we further boost the accuracy of our best models? That's what we will try to do using ensemble method. Ensembles combine predictions from different models to generate a final prediction, and the more models we include the better it performs. Better still, because ensembles combine baseline predictions, they perform at least as well as the best baseline model. Most of the errors from a model’s learning are from three main factors: variance, noise, and bias. By using ensemble methods, we’re able to increase the stability of the final model and reduce the errors caused by bias, variance, and noise. By combining many models, we’re able to (mostly) reduce the variance, even when they are individually not great, as we won’t suffer from random errors from a single source. **The main principle behind ensemble modelling is to group weak learners together to form one strong learner. The most basic ensemble is majority voting rule (where the prediction or vote given by the majority of the models used as final prediction).But there are many other ways to combine predictions, and more generally we can use a model to learn how to best combine predictions.**

# **To implement an ensemble we need three basic things:**
# 1. A group of base learners that generate predictions.
# 2. A meta learner that learns how to best combine these predictions outputed by base learners.
# 3. And finally a method for splitting the training data between the base learners and the meta learner.
# 
# **An ensemble works best if:**
# 1. There is a less correlation in the base models' predictions.
# 2. We increase the number of base learners though it might slow the process down.
# 
# 
# ## 14.1 Different Ensemble Methods
# We would first categorize ensemble methods into two subcategories like 1.Simple Ensemble Methods and 2.Advanced Ensemble Methods
# 
# ### 14.1.1 Simple Ensemble Methods
# They're the simpliest yet so useful form of enselbles. They can be further categorised into 
# 1. Voting, 
# 2. Averaging and 
# 3. Weighted Average. 
# 
# First one is usually used for classification while the later two are used for regression problems.
# 
# #### 14.1.1.1 Voting Ensemble  
# Voting ensemble is further classified into 
# 1. Hard voting and 
# 2. Soft voting.
# 
# ##### 14.1.1.1.1 Hard Voting (or Majority Voting or Max Voting) <a id="14.1"></a>
# This hard voting method is usually used for classification problems. The idea is to train multiple models to make predictions for each data point. The predictions by each model are considered as a ‘vote’. The predictions which we get from the majority of the models are used as the final prediction. Say rf and lr predict a class as 1 while knn predicts the same class as 0. Since the majority of the vots is casted in favour of class 1, the voting classifier would predict the very same class as 1. See the table below to understand how hard voting ensemble works.

# In[ ]:

data = [[1, 1, 1, 0, 1], 
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]
display(pd.DataFrame(data, columns= ["Class","RF", "LR", "KNN", "Hard_voting"]).set_index("Class"))


# **Correlation among Base Models Predictions:** How base models' predictions are correlated? If base models' predictions are weakly correlated with each other, the ensemble will likely to perform better. On the other hand, for a strong correlation of predictions among the base models, the ensemble will unlikely to perform better. To sumarize, diversity of predictions among the base models is inversely proportional to the ensemble accuracy. Let's make prediction for the test set.

# In[ ]:

# **Findings:** The prediction looks quite similar for the 8 classifiers except when DT is compared to the others classifiers. Now we will create an ensemble with the base models RF, GBC, DT, KNN and LR. This ensemble can be called heterogeneous ensemble since we have three tree based, one kernel based and one linear models. We would use **EnsembleVotingClassifier method from mlxtend module** for both hard and soft voting ensembles. The advantage is it requires lesser codes to plot decision regions and I find it a bit faster than sklearn's voting classifier.

# **Findings:** We can see Hard voting classifier uses RF as meta learner for this problem that beats the best base learners (rf and gbc) by some margin. So we may want to further investigate how hard voting is using its decision boundary to excel our best base learners. Let's visualize the decision regions of hard voting classifier with base classifiers.
# 
# **Now we have a new challenge. In machine learning, visualizing 2 or 3 dimensional data is not that challenging. But we have 47 dimensions (47 input features). That's way too much to visualize. So we need to reduce the dimensionality- may be into 2 or 3 dimensionality. That's where PCA comes into play.**
# 
# ### **Introduction to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <a id="14.2"></a>
# The main goal of a PCA analysis is to identify patterns in data. PCA aims to detect the correlation between variables. If a strong correlation between variables exists, the attempt to reduce the dimensionality only makes sense. In a nutshell, this is what PCA is all about: Finding the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and project it onto a smaller dimensional subspace while retaining most of the information. PCA is very useful in the following two cases:
# 1. When the training process takes too long due to large input dimension of training data.
# 2. Reducing dimensions, it make data visualization a breeze.
# 
# PCA is often effected if your input features have different ranges. So to make PCA work better we shoud scale the input features. We would use sklearn's StandardScaler to standarize our input features. The idea behind StandardScaler is that it will transform our data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1. **If the variables are correlated, PCA can achieve dimension reduction. If not, PCA just orders them according to their variances.**
# 
# **Now let's perform standarization and then PCA to plot decision regions of different trained classifiers.**

# **Looking at this plot, one thing we can say that a linear decision boundary will not be a good choice to separate these two classes. Now we would train our models on this 2d transformed samples to visualize decision regions created by them.**
# 
# **Note:** PCA gives you an intuition if a linear or non-linear algorithms would be suitable for a problem. For example, if we look at the scatter plot, we see a non-linear trend between the two class that is, of course better seperable by a non-linear decision boundary. So a non-linear model would be a better bet than a linear one. That's why rf(non-linear) performs better than lr(linear model) for this problem.

# 
# ##### 14.1.1.1.2 Soft Voting <a id="14.3"></a>
# On the other hand, When an ensembles averages based on probabilities  we refer to it as soft voting. In an ensemble model, all classifiers (algorithms) are able to estimate class probabilities (i.e., they all have predict_proba() method), then we can specify Scikit-Learn to predict the class with the highest probability, averaged over all the individual classifiers. In a voting classifier setting the voting parameter to 'soft' enables the models to calculate their probability(also known as confidence score) individually and present it to the voting classifier, then the voting classifier averages them and outputs the class with the highest probability. If average probablity of class-1 is greater than class-0, it outputs predicted class is 1 otherwise 0. 
# 
# **Note:** This soft-voting classifier often work better than hard-voting as it gives more weight to highly confident votes. We Need to specify voting=”soft” and ensure that all classifiers can estimate class probabilities. One algorithm where we need to be careful is SVC, by default SVC will not give probabilities, we have to specify 'probability' hyperparameter to True.

# #### 14.1.2.1 Bagging  <a id="14.4"></a>
# Bagging, is shorthand for the combination of bootstrapping and aggregating. Bootstrapping is a method to help decrease the variance of the classifier and thus reduce overfitting. So the model created should be less overfitted than a single individual model. Bagging is more suitable for high variance low bias models (complex models). Random forest itself is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that follows the bagging technique. We would use rf as the base estimator for bagging instead of default dt. Let's try to implement bagging in sklearn:

# 
# #### 14.1.2.2 Boosting  <a id="14.5"></a>
# Boosting refers to any Ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into a strong learner. It does this through a weighted majority vote (classification) or a weighted sum (regression). Ada boost and Gradient boost, and Extreme gradient boost are popular models that uses boosting technique. Boosting is particularly suitable for low variance high bias models (less complex models). Unlike bagging, its a sequential ensemble technique. We will perform a simple voting ensemble of boosting classifiers rather performing boosting ensemble using only a single classifer with a base estimator (for ada boost). I found this method to give higher accuracy than adaboost(with a base estimator), gradient boosting, or extreme gradient boosting for this problem. Let's perform boosting ensemble(infact voting of boosting classifiers) in mlxtend.

# 
# #### 14.1.2.3 Blending  <a id="14.6"></a>
# In blending, full training data is split into training and prediction sets. The base models (also called level 0 models) are trained on this train set and then predictions are made on this prediction set. These predictions made by base learers are then fed as an input to the meta learner (also called level 1 model). That is meta learner are trained with the output (predictions) of base learners. Blending ensemble uses only a subset of data to train base learners and another subset of data to make predictions. By only fitting every base learner once on a subset of the full training data, Blend ensemble is a fast ensemble that can handle very large datasets simply by only using portion of it at each stage. The cost of this approach is that information is thrown out at each stage, as one layer will not see the training data used by the previous layer. **We will use BlendEnsemble method from mlens.ensemble module to perform blending.**

# #### 14.1.2.4 Stacking (Or Stacked Generalization)  <a id="14.7"></a>
# In blending, we trained the base learners and the meta learner on only half the data, so a lot of information is lost. To prevent this, we need to use a cross-validation strategy. Fitting an ensemble with cross-validation is often referred to as stacking, while the ensemble itself is known as the Super Learner. So basically in stacking, the individual classification models (or base models) are trained on the complete training set; then, the meta-classifier is fitted on the outputs (predictions) of those base learners. The meta-classifier can either be trained on the predicted class labels or probabilities from the ensemble.
# 
# **The basic difference between blending and stacking is therefore that stacking allows both base learners and the meta learner to train on the full data set.The outcome of stacking is improved accuracy which is typical for small and medium-sized data sets, where the effect of blending can be severe. As the data set size increases, blending and stacking performs similarly and hence for large data sets blending is preferred over stacking since stacking takes significant amount of time to train the ensemble. We will use package vecstack to perform stacking that can save you from writing a lot of codes if you implement stacking from scratch.**

# **Findings:**So there you have it! Surprisingly its bagging that comes out on top with a score of *0.81339* that can take you to the top *4%* on the leaderboard! Random forest (base model) comes second with score 0.80382. Hard voting, stacking and soft voting perform identical and can't beat best base rf. Since bagging performs well for high variance model, we have a feeling that we might have overfitted the training data because cross validation score for bagging is 82.61% and it still scores over 81% on kaggle leaderboard. So its possible to overfit though your cross validation score is high since some models with higher cross validation score perform poorly on kaggle leaderboard compared to bagging ensemble.

# **If you're still with me, I congratulate you because you've learned all those things that I learned after months of study, practice and of course patience. Of course, there is always room for improvement. I'm still learning. I've tried to explain everything I could possibly know. Any suggestion is cordially welcomed. May be trying out different base learners and meta learner to improve ensemble further or may be by tunning xgbc. And if you find my kernel useful, some upvotes will be appreciated.  I have also another kernel for advanced house price regression problem that you might find useful as well.**
