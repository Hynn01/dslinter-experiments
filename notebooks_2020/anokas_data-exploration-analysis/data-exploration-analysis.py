# ## Classifying the Amazon Rainforest
# 
# Welcome back to another satellite imagery competition - these seem to be in fashion lately :) This time, unlike other recent satellite imagery competitions, we have to add tags to each image (which are segments of a larger image of the Amazon Rainforest). However, since each image can have multiple labels, that makes this a **multi-label** classification challenge as opposed to standard multi-class problem.
# 
# **And as always, if this helped you, some upvotes would be very much appreciated - that's where I get my motivation! :D**

# Time to get straight into the data:

# Wow, so Kaggle Kernels has the full data! (Thanks Kaggle Team! :))
# 
# Looks like we have 40k images for training, and 40k images for testing.
# The jpegs are on average **15KB**, and the tifs are on average **538KB**. The JPEGs seem a little on the small side, but TIFFs look like they will retain most of the quality.
# 
# Before we open up the images, let's take a look at the `train.csv`.
# ## Training Data

# In[ ]:


df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')
df_train.head()


# Okay, so our training metadata is super basic. It looks like we are just given names and the corresponding tags. Let's parse them and do some analysis

# In[ ]:


labels = df_train['tags'].apply(lambda x: x.split(' '))


# So it looks like we are not given much metadata, only the filenames and the corresponding tags. Let's parse these tags so that we can analyze them further.

# In[ ]:


labels = df_train['tags'].apply(lambda x: x.split(' '))

# It's worth noting that this co-occurence matrix shows **what percentage of the X label also has the Y label** - I think this shows more information than the standard symmetrical matrix.
# 
# We can see that the label "primary" has the highest proportion of labels.

# ## Images
# Now, what you all came for. Let's load some of the images, and their corresponding labels.
