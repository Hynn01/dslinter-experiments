# In the United States, animal bites are often reported to law enforcement (such as animal control). The main concern with an animal bite is that the animal may be rabid. This dataset includes information on over 9,000 animal bites which occurred near Louisville, Kentucky from 1985 to 2017 and includes information on whether the animal was quarantined after the bite occurred and whether that animal was rabid.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np #linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import seaborn as sns # visualization library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# **Features of Animal Bite Data**

# * bite_date: The date the bite occurred
# * SpeciesIDDesc: The species of animal that did the biting
# * BreedIDDesc: Breed (if known)
# * GenderIDDesc: Gender (of the animal)
# * color: color of the animal
# * vaccination_yrs: how many years had passed since the last vaccination
# * vaccination_date: the date of the last vaccination
# * victim_zip: the zipcode of the victim
# * AdvIssuedYNDesc: whether advice was issued
# * WhereBittenIDDesc: Where on the body the victim was bitten
# * quarantine_date: whether the animal was quarantined
# * DispositionIDDesc: whether the animal was released from quarantine
# * head_sent_date: the date the animalâ€™s head was sent to the lab
# * release_date: the date the animal was released
# * ResultsIDDesc: results from lab tests (for rabies)

# ** Common Feature of 4 Rabid Animal**
# * There are 4 rabid animal that are 3 bat and 1 dog.
# * Information of bats are nan
# * Information of dog is greatpyreneese, female and white.

# **CONCULUSION**
# * In my opinion that is not related to result of data analysis, people who have dog are more dangerous than others who have cats. Because animals do  what their owners say e
# * ** If you have any suggest or question, I will be happy to hear it.**
