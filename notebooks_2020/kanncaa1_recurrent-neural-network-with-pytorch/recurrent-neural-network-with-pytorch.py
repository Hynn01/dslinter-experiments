# ## INTRODUCTION
# - Itâ€™s a Python based scientific computing package targeted at two sets of audiences:
#     - A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs
#     - Deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed
# - pros: 
#     - Iinteractively debugging PyTorch. Many users who have used both frameworks would argue that makes pytorch significantly easier to debug and visualize.
#     - Clean support for dynamic graphs
#     - Organizational backing from Facebook
#     - Blend of high level and low level APIs
# - cons:
#     - Much less mature than alternatives
#     - Limited references / resources outside of the official documentation
# - I accept you know neural network basics. If you do not know check my tutorial. Because I will not explain neural network concepts detailed, I only explain how to use pytorch for neural network
# - Neural Network tutorial: https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/deep-learning-tutorial-for-beginners 
# - The most important parts of this tutorial from matrices to ANN. If you learn these parts very well, implementing remaining parts like CNN or RNN will be very easy.

# ### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
# - RNN is essentially repeating ANN but information get pass through from previous non-linear activation function output.
# - **Steps of RNN:**
#     1. Import Libraries
#     1. Prepare Dataset
#     1. Create RNN Model
#         - hidden layer dimension is 100
#         - number of hidden layer is 1 
#     1. Instantiate Model
#     1. Instantiate Loss
#         - Cross entropy loss
#         - It also has softmax(logistic function) in it.
#     1. Instantiate Optimizer
#         - SGD Optimizer
#     1. Traning the Model
#     1. Prediction

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
