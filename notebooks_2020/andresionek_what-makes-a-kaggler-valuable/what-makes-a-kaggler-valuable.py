# # What Makes a Kaggler Valuable? 
# Ever wondered what you should do to add some weight to your Data Science resume? Many of us already have a good notion of what is important to build a strong data science career. Of what is relevant to increase our compensation. But I personally, have never seen a systematic, data based, approach to this problem. That was the motivation of building a model to explain what makes a data scientist valuable to the market. Some results are pretty obvious, but many others might really help you boost your earnings.

# ## Learning how to increase your own compensation
# We only could do this study because Kaggle has released the data from its [second annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018). The survey was live for one week in October 2018 and got a total of 23,859 responses. The results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists to break into the field.
# 
# With access to that data, we wanted to understand what affects a Kaggler’s compensation (we are calling Kaggler anyone that answered the survey). Our idea was to give you precise insights of what is more valuable to the market, so you can stop spending time on things that won’t have a good ROI (return on investment) and speed up towards higher compensation. Following those insights, extracted from data, I hope one day you might find yourself laying down on a pile of money like Mr. Babineaux down here.

# ## Considerations
# 1. We are assuming that respondents were honest and sincere in their answers.
# 2. This may not represent the whole universe of data professionals (it only has answers from Kaggle users), but it's a good proxy.
# 
# # Basic Cleaning
# Survey answers are messy... Most survey softwares dont deliver the data on tidy format, and it is exactly the case of this survey. So we are going to have some really hard work to clean it. First lets just look at some personal data and clean it while we do our EDA.

# # EDA - Studying the problem: How personal data affects compensation?
# 
# Now that we have done a basic data cleaning, we are able to do some in depth EDA and ultimately build a model to predict the earnings of data scientists and find the most important features that affect compensation. Because we had 50 multiple choice questions, many of them with multiple answers, we will do an EDA only to analyse how personal data correlates to compensation. Other features will be used later on this study, on the modeling step.
# 
# **Note about splitting the data into train and test sets:** 
# 1. Ideally we would split the data into train and test sets before doing the Exploratory Data Analysis. This is good practice to avoid cognitive bias and overfitting the data. I'm not doing it here because I have already studied many of this dataset's kernels before start working on the data, so I'm probably already biased. 
# 2. We also have static data, I mean we are not getting any new answers from this survey. If we do the EDA and impute NaNs with the whole dataset, instead of just the training set, we shouldn't have any problem, because we are working with the full universe of data available.

# We see that countries that have a higher cost of living are showing up at the top, paying more. Let's try to divide the average compensation by the cost of living to normalize this feature? We found a ranking of cost of living per country at [Expatistan.com](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/ranking) on Nov. 15th 2018. This source also provide a price index for each country, that is calculated as described below: 
# 
# > To calculate each country's Price Index value, we start by assigning a value of 100 to a central reference country (that happens to be the Czech Republic). Once the reference point has been established, the Price Index value of every other country in the database is calculated by comparing their cost of living to the cost of living in the Czech Republic.
# Therefore, if a country has a Price Index of 134, that means that living there is 34% more expensive than living in the Czech Republic. Source: [Expatistan.com](https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/country/ranking)

# ## Reducing Answers Dimensions
# Some answers have multiple choices, to avoid overfitting we will drop all answers that had less than 5% of respondents. I'm doing this because we could have some answers with just a few respondents biasing the model towards the Top20%. One example below:
# 
# 1. On average we expect each answer to have around 80% of the respondents from the Bottom 80% and the rest from the Top 20%. 
# 2. Let's say we get an answer that has only 10 respondents, and 4 of them are in the Top 20%. This makes this answer very strong towards the top 20%.
# 3. Our model will probably consider this feature very important (because the odds of belonging to the Top 20% is much greater to who ansered that question, odds are 40% in fact).
# 4. But... A question with only 10 respondents is not representative of the whole population, so our model will be overfitted.
# 5. Dropping answers that have less than 5% of respondents will avoid this kind of overfitting, because we know that each answer represents at least 5% of our population. 
# 6. It's better to have a slightly underfitted than a overfitted model.
# 
# *Why 5%? Because it's round and because I want it to be 5%. Could be 10%, 15%, 20%... Try it out and see how the results change.*

# We see on the above chart that the two classes are very well defined, and distinct from each other. This is confirmed when we plot the ROC curve.
# 
# > In a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve the true positive rate (Sensitivity) is plotted in function of the false positive rate (100-Specificity) for different cut-off points. Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity/specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. A test with perfect discrimination (no overlap in the two distributions) has a ROC curve that passes through the upper left corner (100% sensitivity, 100% specificity). Therefore the closer the ROC curve is to the upper left corner, the higher the overall accuracy of the test (Zweig & Campbell, 1993).

# We will deploy a web page to collect some answers and send it to our model. We expect it to send us the content by QueryString parameters, after decoding that on AWS API Gateway we have a simple json that looks like this:

# In[ ]:


input_json = {
    "Q1": "q1_other",
    "Q2": "q2_25_29",
    "Q3": "q3_united_",
    "Q4": "q4_other",
    "Q6": "q6_student",
    "Q7": "q7_other2",
    "Q8": "q8_2_3",

    "q11_build_": "on",
    "q15_amazon": "on",
    "other": "on",

# To deploy this model we had basically two options:
# 1. Export the model as as serialized object, load into AWS lambda and start making predictions.
# 2. [Parametrize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametrization) the model and load all coefficients and intercept manually to Lambda.
# 
# I'm choosing the second option because I want the model to be transparent to anyone. It should be clear what the coefficients are and how the score is calculated. A serialized model wouldn't let us see that in detail.
# 
# #### Parametrization: What the hell is that?
# A Logistic Regression model can be written like this:
# 
# ```log-odds = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn``` 
# 
# **Where:**
# * ```b0``` is the intercept
# * ```b1, b2, bn``` are the coefficients
# * ```x1, x2, xn``` are the variables
# 
# We trained our model and got all coefficient's values. So it's just a matter of writing that equation manually. Then to get scores between 0 and 1 we do:
# 
# ```scores = 1 / (1 + exp(-(b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn)))```
# 
# ### Treating all model's coefficients to have a single naming convention

# In[ ]:


import re
# treating the questions to match the input json
features = pd.DataFrame([Xtrain.columns, lreg.coef_[0]]).transpose()
features.columns = ['feature', 'coefficient']
features['answer'] = features.feature
features['answer'] = features['answer'].apply(lambda x: re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z0-9]+", ' ', x))
features['answer'] = features['answer'].str.replace(' ', '_')
features['answer'] = features['answer'].str.lower()
features['answer'] = features['answer'].str.replace('_build_and_or_', '_')
features['answer'] = features['answer'].str.replace('_metrics_that_consider_', '_')
features['answer'] = features['answer'].str[:10]

features['question_number'] = features['answer'].str.split('_').str[0]
features = features[['question_number', 'answer', 'coefficient']]
features.head(3)


# Then we treat the input json to keep it at the same naming convention.

# In[ ]:


# treating the input json to keep it in the same format as the coeficcients
def treat_input(input_json):
    treated = dict()
    for key, value in input_json.items():
        if key[0] == 'Q':
            treated[value] = 1
        else:
            treated[key] = 1
    return treated

treated_input_json = treat_input(input_json)
print('First 8 elements of the treated input:', dict(list(treated_input_json.items())[0:8]))


# ### Mapping input to coefficients and calculating the score

# Now we can map the input json to the coefficients to calculate the points.

# In[ ]:


features['positive'] = features['answer'].map(treated_input_json)
features.fillna(0, inplace=True)
features['points'] = features.positive * features.coefficient
features.head(5)


# To get the final score we sum all points, them sum it with the intercept and them normalize to get values between 0 and 1000.

# In[ ]:


from math import exp
# Creating a function to normalize the scores between 0 and 1000

def normalize(points):
    """
    Normalize to get values between 0 and 1000
    """
    return int(1 / (1 + exp(-points)) * 1000)

# suming all points + intercept then normalizing between 0 and 1
score = features['points'].sum() + lreg.intercept_[0]
print('Calculated score is:', normalize(score))


# ## Implementing the parametrized model as a AWS Lambda Function.
# To get this model into production, we are creating a Lambda function that receives the input json through an API Gateway Integration, calculates the score and then returns it to the API. You can access the API by doing a simple POST with the input json at the body.
# 
# [**All code for Lambda are available at this git.**](https://github.com/andresionek91/kaggle-top20-predictor)
# 
# Instructions on how to deploy a model to AWS lambda were found on this [Towards Data Science post, by Ben Weber](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-for-startups-model-services-2facf2dde81d).
# 
# ### Below we test the API using requests
# Notice that the usage is limited to 1 request/second at this moment.
# 

# In[ ]:


import requests
import json

input_json = {
    "Q1": "q1_other",
    "Q2": "q2_25_29",
    "Q3": "q3_united_",
    "Q4": "q4_other",
    "Q6": "q6_student",
    "Q7": "q7_other2",
    "Q8": "q8_2_3",
    "Q10": "q10_we_rec",
    "q11_analyz": "on",

url = 'https://tk9k0fkvyj.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/top20-predictor'

requests.post(url, params=treated_input_json, headers=header).json()


# ## Getting the Number of Requests Made to the API
# Our Lambda function is also saving each input and the resulting score as a json object inside a S3 Bucket. We wrote another lambda function, and an API, to count the number of objects in a bucket.

# Making a get to our API. It triggers a lambda function that counts the number of objects inside our bucket.

requests.get(url).json()


# ## Creating a Flask App
# Next we created a Flask App to run our html and collect answers from a form, send it to lambda and show the result to the user. It was deployed using AWS Beanstalk.
# 
# [More detailed instructions on app deployment are available here](https://medium.com/p/2ece8e66d98c/)
