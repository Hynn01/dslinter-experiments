# # Aim
# Since my first week on this platform, I have been fascinated by the topic of **time series analysis.** This kernel is prepared to be a container of many broad topics in the field of time series analysis. My motive is to make this the ultimate reference to time series analysis for beginners and experienced people alike.
# 
# # Some important things
# 1. This kernel **is a work in progress so every time you see on your home feed and open it, you will surely find fresh content.**
# 2. I am doing this only after completing various courses in this field. I continue to study more advanced concepts to provide more knowledge and content.
# 3. If there is any suggestion or any specific topic you would like me to cover, kindly mention that in the comments.
# 4. **If you like my work, be sure to upvote**(press the like button) this kernel so it looks more relevant and meaningful to the community.

# ## <a id='1.1'>1.1 Importing time series data</a>

# ### How to import data?
# First, we import all the datasets needed for this kernel. The required time series column is imported as a datetime column using **parse_dates** parameter and is also selected as index of the dataframe using **index_col** parameter. 
# #### Data being used:-
# 1. Google  Stocks Data
# 2. Humidity in different world cities
# 3. Microsoft  Stocks Data
# 3. Pressure in different world cities

google = pd.read_csv('../input/stock-time-series-20050101-to-20171231/GOOGL_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=['Date'])
google.head()


# In[ ]:


humidity = pd.read_csv('../input/historical-hourly-weather-data/humidity.csv', index_col='datetime', parse_dates=['datetime'])
humidity.tail()


# ## <a id='1.2'>1.2 Cleaning and preparing time series data</a>

# ### How to prepare data?
# Google stocks data doesn't have any missing values but humidity data does have its fair share of missing values. It is cleaned using **fillna()** method with **ffill** parameter which propagates last valid observation to fill gaps

# In[ ]:


humidity = humidity.iloc[1:]
humidity = humidity.fillna(method='ffill')
humidity.head()


# ## <a id='1.3'>1.3 Visualizing the datasets</a>

# In[ ]:


humidity["Kansas City"].asfreq('M').plot() # asfreq method is used to convert a time series to a specified frequency. Here it is monthly frequency.
plt.title('Humidity in Kansas City over time(Monthly frequency)')
plt.show()


# In[ ]:


google['2008':'2010'].plot(subplots=True, figsize=(10,12))
plt.title('Google stock attributes from 2008 to 2010')
plt.savefig('stocks.png')
plt.show()


# ## <a id='1.4'>1.4 Timestamps and Periods</a>

# ### What are timestamps and periods and how are they useful?
# Timestamps are used to represent a point in time. Periods represent an interval in time. Periods can used to check if a specific event in the given period. They can also be converted to each other's form.

# In[ ]:


# Creating a Timestamp
timestamp = pd.Timestamp(2017, 1, 1, 12)
timestamp


# In[ ]:


# Creating a period
period = pd.Period('2017-01-01')
period


# In[ ]:


# Checking if the given timestamp exists in the given period
period.start_time < timestamp < period.end_time

# Converting timestamp to period
new_period = timestamp.to_period(freq='H')
new_period


# In[ ]:


# Converting period to timestamp
new_timestamp = period.to_timestamp(freq='H', how='start')
new_timestamp


# ## <a id='1.5'>1.5 Using date_range</a>

# ### What is date_range and how is it useful?
# **date_range** is a method that returns  a fixed frequency datetimeindex. It is quite useful when creating your own time series attribute for pre-existing data or arranging the whole data around the time series attribute created by you.

# In[ ]:


# Creating a datetimeindex with daily frequency
dr1 = pd.date_range(start='1/1/18', end='1/9/18')
dr1


# In[ ]:


# Creating a datetimeindex with monthly frequency
dr2 = pd.date_range(start='1/1/18', end='1/1/19', freq='M')
dr2


# In[ ]:


# Creating a datetimeindex without specifying start date and using periods
dr3 = pd.date_range(end='1/4/2014', periods=8)
dr3


# In[ ]:


# Creating a datetimeindex specifying start date , end date and periods
dr4 = pd.date_range(start='2013-04-24', end='2014-11-27', periods=3)
dr4


# ## <a id='1.6'>1.6 Using to_datetime</a> 

# pandas.to_datetime() is used for converting arguments to datetime. Here, a DataFrame is converted to a datetime series.

# In[ ]:


df = pd.DataFrame({'year': [2015, 2016], 'month': [2, 3], 'day': [4, 5]})
df


# In[ ]:


df = pd.to_datetime(df)
df


# In[ ]:


df = pd.to_datetime('01-01-2017')
df


# ## <a id='1.7'>1.7 Shifting and lags</a>

# We can shift index by desired number of periods with an optional time frequency. This is useful when comparing the time series with a past of itself

# In[ ]:


humidity["Vancouver"].asfreq('M').plot(legend=True)
shifted = humidity["Vancouver"].asfreq('M').shift(10).plot(legend=True)
shifted.legend(['Vancouver','Vancouver_lagged'])
plt.show()


# ## <a id='#1.8'>1.8 Resampling</a>
# **Upsampling** - Time series is resampled from low frequency to high frequency(Monthly to daily frequency). It involves filling or interpolating missing data
# 
# **Downsampling** - Time series is resampled from high frequency to low frequency(Weekly to monthly frequency). It involves aggregation of existing data.
# 

# In[ ]:


# Let's use pressure data to demonstrate this
pressure = pd.read_csv('../input/historical-hourly-weather-data/pressure.csv', index_col='datetime', parse_dates=['datetime'])
pressure.tail()


# Sigh! A lot of cleaning is required.

# In[ ]:


pressure = pressure.iloc[1:]
pressure = pressure.fillna(method='ffill')
pressure.tail()


# In[ ]:


pressure = pressure.fillna(method='bfill')
pressure.head()


# First, we used **ffill** parameter which propagates last valid observation to fill gaps. Then we use **bfill** to propogate next valid observation to fill gaps.

# In[ ]:


# Shape before resampling(downsampling)
pressure.shape


# In[ ]:


# We downsample from hourly to 3 day frequency aggregated using mean
pressure = pressure.resample('3D').mean()
pressure.head()


# In[ ]:


# Shape after resampling(downsampling)
pressure.shape


# Much less rows are left. Now, we will upsample from 3 day frequency to daily frequency

# In[ ]:


pressure = pressure.resample('D').pad()
pressure.head()


# In[ ]:


# Shape after resampling(upsampling)
pressure.shape


# Again an increase in number of rows. Resampling is cool when used properly.

# ## <a id='2.4'>2.4 Comaring two or more time series</a> 

# We will compare 2 time series by normalizing them. This is achieved by dividing each time series element of all time series by the first element. This way both series start at the same point and can be easily compared.

# In[ ]:


# We choose microsoft stocks to compare them with google
microsoft = pd.read_csv('../input/stock-time-series-20050101-to-20171231/MSFT_2006-01-01_to_2018-01-01.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=['Date'])

# ## <a id='2.6'>2.6 OHLC charts</a>
# An OHLC chart is any type of price chart that shows the open, high, low and close price of a certain time period. Open-high-low-close Charts (or OHLC Charts) are used as a trading tool to visualise and analyse the price changes over time for securities, currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. OHLC Charts are useful for interpreting the day-to-day sentiment of the market and forecasting any future price changes through the patterns produced.
# 
# The y-axis on an OHLC Chart is used for the price scale, while the x-axis is the timescale. On each single time period, an OHLC Charts plots a symbol that represents two ranges: the highest and lowest prices traded, and also the opening and closing price on that single time period (for example in a day). On the range symbol, the high and low price ranges are represented by the length of the main vertical line. The open and close prices are represented by the vertical positioning of tick-marks that appear on the left (representing the open price) and on right (representing the close price) sides of the high-low vertical line.
# 
# Colour can be assigned to each OHLC Chart symbol, to distinguish whether the market is "bullish" (the closing price is higher then it opened) or "bearish" (the closing price is lower then it opened).

#  ## <a id='2.7'>2.7 Candlestick charts</a>
# This type of chart is used as a trading tool to visualise and analyse the price movements over time for securities, derivatives, currencies, stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. Although the symbols used in Candlestick Charts resemble a Box Plot, they function differently and therefore, are not to be confused with one another.
# 
# Candlestick Charts display multiple bits of price information such as the open price, close price, highest price and lowest price through the use of candlestick-like symbols. Each symbol represents the compressed trading activity for a single time period (a minute, hour, day, month, etc). Each Candlestick symbol is plotted along a time scale on the x-axis, to show the trading activity over time.
# 
# The main rectangle in the symbol is known as the real body, which is used to display the range between the open and close price of that time period. While the lines extending from the bottom and top of the real body is known as the lower and upper shadows (or wick). Each shadow represents the highest or lowest price traded during the time period represented. When the market is Bullish (the closing price is higher than it opened), then the body is coloured typically white or green. But when the market is Bearish (the closing price is lower than it opened), then the body is usually coloured either black or red.
# 
# <img src="https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/images/anatomy/SVG/candlestick_chart.svg">
# 
# Candlestick Charts are great for detecting and predicting market trends over time and are useful for interpreting the day-to-day sentiment of the market, through each candlestick symbol's colouring and shape. For example, the longer the body is, the more intense the selling or buying pressure is. While, a very short body, would indicate that there is very little price movement in that time period and represents consolidation.
# 
# Candlestick Charts help reveal the market psychology (the fear and greed experienced by sellers and buyers) through the various indicators, such as shape and colour, but also by the many identifiable patterns that can be found in Candlestick Charts. In total, there are 42 recognised patterns that are divided into simple and complex patterns. These patterns found in Candlestick Charts are useful for displaying price relationships and can be used for predicting the possible future movement of the market. You can find a list and description of each pattern here.
# 
# Please bear in mind, that Candlestick Charts don't express the events taking place between the open and close price - only the relationship between the two prices. So you can't tell how volatile trading was within that single time period.

# ## <a id='2.8'>2.8 Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation</a>
# * Autocorrelation - The autocorrelation function (ACF) measures how a series is correlated with itself at different lags.
# * Partial Autocorrelation - The partial autocorrelation function can be interpreted as a regression of the series against its past lags.  The terms can be interpreted the same way as a standard  linear regression, that is the contribution of a change in that particular lag while holding others constant.

# A random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers. 
# 
# In general if we talk about stocks, Today's Price = Yesterday's Price + Noise
# 
# # P<sub>t</sub> = P<sub>t-1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub> 
# 
# Random walks can't be forecasted because well, noise is random.
# 
# Random Walk with Drift(drift(μ) is zero-mean)
# #### P<sub>t</sub> - P<sub>t-1</sub> = μ + ε<sub>t</sub> 
# <br>
# Regression test for random walk 
# #### P<sub>t</sub> = α + βP<sub>t-1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
# #### Equivalent to  P<sub>t</sub> - P<sub>t-1</sub> = α + βP<sub>t-1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
# <br>
# Test:
# #### H<sub>0</sub>: β = 1 (This is a random walk)
# #### H<sub>1</sub>: β < 1 (This is not a random walk)
# <br>
# Dickey-Fuller Test:
# #### H<sub>0</sub>: β = 0 (This is a random walk)
# #### H<sub>1</sub>: β < 0 (This is not a random walk)

# ### Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
# An augmented Dickey–Fuller test (ADF) tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series sample. It is basically Dickey-Fuller test with more lagged changes on RHS.

# ## <a id='3.4'>3.4 Stationarity</a>
# A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time.
# * Strong stationarity:  is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time.
# * Weak stationarity: is a process where mean, variance, autocorrelation are constant throughout the time
# 
# Stationarity is important as  non-stationary series that depend on time have too many parameters to account for when modelling the time series. diff() method can easily convert a non-stationary series to a stationary series.

# ## <a id='4.1'>4.1 AR models</a>
#  An autoregressive (AR) model is a representation of a type of random process; as such, it is used to describe certain time-varying processes in nature, economics, etc. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term); thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation.
#  #### AR(1) model
#  R<sub>t</sub> = μ + ϕR<sub>t-1</sub> + ε<sub>t</sub>
#  ##### As RHS has only one lagged value(R<sub>t-1</sub>)this is called AR model of order 1 where μ is mean and ε is noise at time t
#  If ϕ = 1, it is random walk. Else if ϕ = 0, it is white noise. Else if -1 < ϕ < 1, it is stationary. If ϕ is -ve, there is men reversion. If ϕ is +ve, there is momentum.

# Autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) models provide a parsimonious description of a (weakly) stationary stochastic process in terms of two polynomials, one for the autoregression and the second for the moving average. It's the fusion of AR and MA models.
# ### ARMA(1,1) model

# ## <a id='4.4'>4.4 ARIMA models</a>
# An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. Both of these models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting). ARIMA models are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity, where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the "integrated" part of the model) can be applied one or more times to eliminate the non-stationarity.
# ARIMA model is of the form: ARIMA(p,d,q): p is AR parameter, d is differential parameter, q is MA parameter
# ### ARIMA(1,0,0)
# **y<sub>t</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>y<sub>t-1</sub> + ϵ<sub>t</sub>**
# ### ARIMA(1,0,1)
# **y<sub>t</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>y<sub>t-1</sub> + ϵ<sub>t</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>ϵ<sub>t-1</sub>**
# ### ARIMA(1,1,1)
# **Δy<sub>t</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>Δy<sub>t-1</sub> + ϵ<sub>t</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>ϵ<sub>t-1</sub>** where **Δy<sub>t</sub> = y<sub>t</sub> - y<sub>t-1</sub>**

# Taking the slight lag into account, this is a fine model.

# ## <a id='4.5'>4.5 VAR models</a>
# Vector autoregression (VAR) is a stochastic process model used to capture the linear interdependencies among multiple time series. VAR models generalize the univariate autoregressive model (AR model) by allowing for more than one evolving variable. All variables in a VAR enter the model in the same way: each variable has an equation explaining its evolution based on its own lagged values, the lagged values of the other model variables, and an error term. VAR modeling does not require as much knowledge about the forces influencing a variable as do structural models with simultaneous equations: The only prior knowledge required is a list of variables which can be hypothesized to affect each other intertemporally.

# A general state space model is of the form

# 
# α<sub>t</sub>=T<sub>t</sub>α<sub>t</sub>−1+c<sub>t</sub>+R<sub>t</sub>η<sub>t</sub>

# η<sub>t</sub>∼N(0,Q<sub>t</sub>)
# 
# The remaining variables (Z<sub>t</sub>,d<sub>t</sub>,H<sub>t</sub>,T<sub>t</sub>,c<sub>t</sub>,R<sub>t</sub>,Q<sub>t</sub>) in the equations are matrices describing the process. Their variable names and dimensions are as follows

# Z : design (k_endog×k_states×nobs)

# d : obs_intercept (k_endog×nobs)

# c : state_intercept (k_states×nobs)
# 
# R : selection (k_states×k_posdef×nobs)
# 
# Q : state_cov (k_posdef×k_posdef×nobs)
# 
# In the case that one of the matrices is time-invariant (so that, for example, Z<sub>t</sub>=Z<sub>t</sub>+1 ∀ <sub>t</sub>), its last dimension may be of size 1 rather than size nobs.
# 
# This generic form encapsulates many of the most popular linear time series models (see below) and is very flexible, allowing estimation with missing observations, forecasting, impulse response functions, and much more.
