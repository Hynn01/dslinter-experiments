#  1. In this problem we have to use 30 different columns and we have to predict the Stage of Breast Cancer M (Malignant)  and B (Bengin)
#  2. This analysis has been done using Basic Machine Learning Algorithm with detailed explanation
#  3. This is good for beginners like as me Lets start.
#  
# 4.Attribute Information:
# 
# 1) ID number
# 
# 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
# 
# -3-32.Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
# 
# a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
# 
# b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
# 
# c) perimeter
# 
# d) area
# 
# e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
# 
# f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
# 
# g). concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
# 
# h). concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
# 
# i). symmetry
# 
# j). fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
# 
# 5  here 3- 32 are divided into three parts first is Mean (3-13),  Stranded Error(13-23) and  Worst(23-32) and each contain 10 parameter (radius, texture,area, perimeter, smoothness,compactness,concavity,concave points,symmetry and fractal dimension) 
# 
#  6. Here Mean means the means of the all cells,  standard Error of all cell and worst means the worst  cell

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv), data manipulation as in SQL
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # this is used for the plot the graph 
import seaborn as sns # used for plot interactive graph. I like it most for plot
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression # to apply the Logistic regression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # to split the data into two parts
from sklearn.cross_validation import KFold # use for cross validation
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV# for tuning parameter
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier # for random forest classifier
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn import svm # for Support Vector Machine
from sklearn import metrics # for the check the error and accuracy of the model
# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
# dont worry about the error if its not working then insteda of model_selection we can use cross_validation


# **Import data **

# In[ ]:


data = pd.read_csv("../input/data.csv",header=0)# here header 0 means the 0 th row is our coloumn 
                                                # header in data


# In[ ]:


# have a look at the data
print(data.head(2))# as u can see our data have imported and having 33 columns
# head is used for to see top 5 by default I used 2 so it will print 2 rows
# If we will use print(data.tail(2))# it will print last 2 rows in data


# In[ ]:


# now lets look at the type of data we have. We can use 
data.info()


# *As I said I m beginner, so here I am explaining every thing in detail.
# 
#  1.So lets describe what these data type means, e.g 5 radius_mean 569 non-null float64 that means the radius_mean have 569 float type value.
# 
# 2. Now we can see Unnamed:32 have 0 non null object it means the all values are null in this column so we cannot use this column for our analysis*

# In[ ]:


# now we can drop this column Unnamed: 32
data.drop("Unnamed: 32",axis=1,inplace=True) # in this process this will change in our data itself 
# if you want to save your old data then you can use below code
# data1=data.drop("Unnamed:32",axis=1)
# here axis 1 means we are droping the column


# In[ ]:


# here you can check the column has been droped
data.columns # this gives the column name which are persent in our data no Unnamed: 32 is not now there


# In[ ]:


# like this we also don't want the Id column for our analysis
data.drop("id",axis=1,inplace=True)


# In[ ]:


# As I said above the data can be divided into three parts.lets divied the features according to their category
features_mean= list(data.columns[1:11])
features_se= list(data.columns[11:20])
features_worst=list(data.columns[21:31])
print(features_mean)
print("-----------------------------------")
print(features_se)
print("------------------------------------")
print(features_worst)


# In[ ]:


# lets now start with features_mean 
# now as ou know our diagnosis column is a object type so we can map it to integer value
data['diagnosis']=data['diagnosis'].map({'M':1,'B':0})


# ## Explore the Data now

# In[ ]:


data.describe() # this will describe the all statistical function of our data


# In[ ]:


# lets get the frequency of cancer stages
sns.countplot(data['diagnosis'],label="Count")


# In[ ]:


# from this graph we can see that there is a more number of bengin stage of cancer which can be cure


# ## Data Analysis a little feature selection

# In[ ]:


# now lets draw a correlation graph so that we can remove multi colinearity it means the columns are
# dependenig on each other so we should avoid it because what is the use of using same column twice
# lets check the correlation between features
# now we will do this analysis only for features_mean then we will do for others and will see who is doing best
corr = data[features_mean].corr() # .corr is used for find corelation
plt.figure(figsize=(14,14))
sns.heatmap(corr, cbar = True,  square = True, annot=True, fmt= '.2f',annot_kws={'size': 15},
           xticklabels= features_mean, yticklabels= features_mean,
           cmap= 'coolwarm') # for more on heatmap you can visit Link(http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html)


# *observation*
# 
#  - the radius, parameter and area  are highly correlated as expected from their relation*
#     so from these we will use anyone of them *
#  - *compactness_mean, concavity_mean and concavepoint_mean are highly correlated so we will use compactness_mean from here *
#  - so selected Parameter for use is perimeter_mean, texture_mean, compactness_mean, symmetry_mean*

# In[ ]:





# In[ ]:


prediction_var = ['texture_mean','perimeter_mean','smoothness_mean','compactness_mean','symmetry_mean']
# now these are the variables which will use for prediction


# In[ ]:


#now split our data into train and test
train, test = train_test_split(data, test_size = 0.3)# in this our main data is splitted into train and test
# we can check their dimension
print(train.shape)
print(test.shape)


# In[ ]:


train_X = train[prediction_var]# taking the training data input 
train_y=train.diagnosis# This is output of our training data
# same we have to do for test
test_X= test[prediction_var] # taking test data inputs
test_y =test.diagnosis   #output value of test dat


# In[ ]:


model=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)# a simple random forest model


# In[ ]:


model.fit(train_X,train_y)# now fit our model for traiing data


# In[ ]:


prediction=model.predict(test_X)# predict for the test data
# prediction will contain the predicted value by our model predicted values of dignosis column for test inputs


# In[ ]:


metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y) # to check the accuracy
# here we will use accuracy measurement between our predicted value and our test output values


# * Here the Accuracy for our model is 91 % which seems good*

# In[ ]:


# lets now try with SVM


# In[ ]:


model = svm.SVC()
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction=model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# **SVM is giving only 0.85 which we can improve by using different techniques** 
# **i will improve it till then beginners can understand how to model a data and they can have a overview of ML**

# *Now lets do this for all feature_mean so that from Random forest we can get the feature which are important**

# In[ ]:


prediction_var = features_mean # taking all features


# In[ ]:


train_X= train[prediction_var]
train_y= train.diagnosis
test_X = test[prediction_var]
test_y = test.diagnosis


# In[ ]:


model=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)


# In[ ]:


model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction = model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


#  - by taking all features accuracy increased but not so much so according to Razor's rule simpler method is better
#  - by the way now lets check the importan features in the prediction

# In[ ]:


featimp = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=prediction_var).sort_values(ascending=False)
print(featimp) # this is the property of Random Forest classifier that it provide us the importance 
# of the features used


# In[ ]:


# first lets do with SVM also using all features


# In[ ]:


model = svm.SVC()
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction=model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# In[ ]:


# as you can see the accuracy of SVM decrease very much
# now lets take only top 5 important features given by RandomForest classifier


# In[ ]:


prediction_var=['concave points_mean','perimeter_mean' , 'concavity_mean' , 'radius_mean','area_mean']      


# In[ ]:


train_X= train[prediction_var]
train_y= train.diagnosis
test_X = test[prediction_var]
test_y = test.diagnosis


# In[ ]:


model=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction = model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# In[ ]:


model = svm.SVC()
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction=model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# In[ ]:


# so from this discussion we got multi colinearty effecting our SVM part a lot 
# but its not affecting so much randomforest because for random forest we dont need to make so much effort for our analysis part
# now lets do with the 3rd part of data which is worst
# first start with all features_worst


# In[ ]:


prediction_var = features_worst


# In[ ]:


train_X= train[prediction_var]
train_y= train.diagnosis
test_X = test[prediction_var]
test_y = test.diagnosis


# In[ ]:


model = svm.SVC()
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction=model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# In[ ]:


# but same problem With SVM, very much less accuray I think we have to tune its parameter
# that i will do later in intermidate part
#now we can get the important features from random forest now run Random Forest for it 


# In[ ]:


model=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction = model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# In[ ]:


# the accuracy for RandomForest invcrease it means the value are more catogrical in Worst part
#lets get the important features
featimp = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=prediction_var).sort_values(ascending=False)
print(featimp) # this is the property of Random Forest classifier that it provide us the importance 
# of the features used


# In[ ]:


# same parameter but with great importance and here it seamed the only conacve points_worst is making 
# very important so it may be bias lets check only for top 5 important features


# In[ ]:


prediction_var = ['concave points_worst','radius_worst','area_worst','perimeter_worst','concavity_worst'] 


# In[ ]:


train_X= train[prediction_var]
train_y= train.diagnosis
test_X = test[prediction_var]
test_y = test.diagnosis


# In[ ]:


model=RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction = model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# In[ ]:


#check for SVM
model = svm.SVC()
model.fit(train_X,train_y)
prediction=model.predict(test_X)
metrics.accuracy_score(prediction,test_y)


# In[ ]:


# now I think for simplicity the Randomforest will be better for prediction


# In[ ]:


# Now explore a little bit more
# now from features_mean i will try to find the variable which can be use for classify
# so lets plot a scatter plot for identify those variable who have a separable boundary between two class
#of cancer


# In[ ]:


# Lets start with the data analysis for features_mean
# Just try to understand which features can be used for prediction
# I will plot scatter plot for the all features_mean for both of diagnosis Category
# and from it we will find which are easily can used for differenciate between two category


# In[ ]:


color_function = {0: "blue", 1: "red"} # Here Red color will be 1 which means M and blue foo 0 means B
colors = data["diagnosis"].map(lambda x: color_function.get(x))# mapping the color fuction with diagnosis column
pd.scatter_matrix(data[features_mean], c=colors, alpha = 0.5, figsize = (15, 15)); # plotting scatter plot matrix


# ** Observation**
# 
# ** 1. Radius, area and perimeter have a strong linear relationship as expected
#      2 As graph shows the features like as texture_mean, smoothness_mean, symmetry_mean and fractal_dimension_mean can t be used for classify two category because both category are mixed there is no separable plane
# 3. So we can remove them from our prediction_var**

# In[ ]:


# So predicton features will be 
features_mean


# In[ ]:


# So predicton features will be 
predictor_var = ['radius_mean','perimeter_mean','area_mean','compactness_mean','concave points_mean']


# In[ ]:


# Now with these variable we will try to explore a liitle bit we will move to how to use cross validiation
# for a detail on cross validation use this link https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/11/improve-model-performance-cross-validation-in-python-r/

# In[ ]:


prediction_var = ['radius_mean','perimeter_mean','area_mean','compactness_mean','concave points_mean']


# In[ ]:


# so those features who are capable of classify classe will be more useful


# In[ ]:


# so in this part i am going to explain about only some concept of machine learnig 
# here I will also compare the accuracy of different models
# I will First use cross validation with different model
# then I will explain about how to to tune the parameter of models using gridSearchCV

# As we are going to use many models lets make a function

        train_X = (data[prediction_input].iloc[train,:])# in this iloc is used for index of trainig data

        train_y = data[output].iloc[train]# here is only column so it repersenting only row in train
        # Training the algorithm using the predictors and target.

# **observation
# 
#  1. Accuracy is 100 % means over fitting 
#  2. but cross validation scores are not good
#  3 so accuracy cant be considered only factor here

# In[ ]:


# now move to svm


# In[ ]:


model = svm.SVC()

# I am facing problem with SVM dont know why?
#lets leave that we will try to do it later

# same here cross validation scores are not good
# now move to RandomForestclassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
classification_model(model,data,prediction_var,outcome_var)


# In[ ]:


# cross validation score are also not bed
# so Random forest is good
# lets try with logistic regression
model=LogisticRegression()

# ** It was a detailed comparison of machine learning models

#  1. In next segment I will try to  explain the tuning of parameter for different models
#  2. Then using those parameter we will try to forecast**

# ** Tuning Parameters  using grid search CV**

#  *Lets Start with decision tree classifier
# Tuning the parameters means using the best parameter for predict 
#  there are many parameters need to model a Machine learning Algorithm
#  for decision tree classifier refer this link [Link](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)*

# 
#  1. the score increase to 95 % 
#  2. Seems to be good
#  3. Lets do with KNN

# *observation*
# 
#  1. The SVM is working fine with good parameter it shows us what is the use of running of parameters
#  2. In the first by using default  I was getting only 70 % accuracy
#  3. But with tuned parameter it is 95 %

#  1. Same we can do for Random Forest classifier
#  2. I will not do that 
#  3. if someone is using this as reference please do for Random Forest Classifier also

#  1. The main objective of this notebook is to provide a hang on the the Machine learning methods
#  2. I think it will be very useful for beginner because in this I have provided every thing that a beginner needs  most
#  3. When I  was a beginner I face many problems finding these all so i tried to make everything available here 
#  4. Thanks
