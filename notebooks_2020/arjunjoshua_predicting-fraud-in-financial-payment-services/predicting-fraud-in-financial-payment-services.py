# This dataset is presently only one of four on Kaggle with information on the rising risk of digital financial fraud, emphasizing the difficulty in obtaining such data. The main technical challenge it poses to predicting fraud is the highly imbalanced distribution between positive and negative classes in 6 million rows of data. Another stumbling block to the utility of this data stems from the possible  discrepancies in its description <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1/discussion/35004'>[1]</a>, <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/lightcc/money-doesn-t-add-up/'>[2]</a>, <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1/discussion/32786'>[3]</a>. The goal of this analysis is to solve both these issues by a detailed data exploration and cleaning followed by choosing a suitable machine-learning algorithm to deal with the skew. I show that an optimal solution based on feature-engineering and extreme gradient-boosted decision trees yields an enhanced predictive power of 0.997, as measured by the area under the precision-recall curve. Crucially, these results were obtained without artificial balancing of the data making this approach  suitable to real-world applications.

# #### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
# In this section and until section 4, we wrangle with the data exclusively using Dataframe methods. This is the most succinct way to gain insights into the dataset. More elaborate visualizations follow in subsequent sections. 

# <a id='fraud-trans'></a>
# ##### 2.1. Which types of transactions are fraudulent? 
# We find that of the five types of transactions, fraud occurs only in two of them (see also kernels by <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/netzone/eda-and-fraud-detection'>Net</a>, <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/philschmidt/where-s-the-money-lebowski'>Philipp Schmidt</a> and <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/ibenoriaki/three-features-with-kneighbors-auc-score-is-0-998'>Ibe_Noriaki</a>):
# 'TRANSFER' where money is sent to a customer / fraudster
# and 'CASH_OUT' where money is sent to a merchant who pays the customer / 
# fraudster
# in cash. Remarkably, the number of 
# fraudulent TRANSFERs almost equals the number of fraudulent CASH_OUTs (see the right half of the plot in section <a href='#time'>5.1</a>). These
# observations appear, at first, to bear out
# the description provided on Kaggle for the modus operandi of fraudulent 
# transactions in 
# this dataset, namely, fraud is committed by first transferring out funds
# to another account which subsequently cashes it out. We will return to this issue later in section <a href='#common-accounts'>2.4</a>

# ##### 2.2. What determines whether the feature *isFlaggedFraud* gets set or not? 
# It turns out that the origin of *isFlaggedFraud* is unclear, contrasting
# with the description provided.
# The 16 entries (out of 6 million) where the *isFlaggedFraud* feature 
# is set 
# do not seem to correlate with any
# explanatory variable. The data is described as *isFlaggedFraud* being set when
# an attempt is made to 'TRANSFER' an 'amount' greater than 200,000. 
# In
# fact, as shown below, *isFlaggedFraud* can remain not set despite this condition being met.

# the 
# transaction is halted <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/lightcc/money-doesn-t-add-up/comments#187011'>[4]</a>.
# Interestingly, *oldBalanceDest* = 0 in every such transaction. However, as shown below, since
# *isFlaggedFraud* can remain not set in TRANSFERS where
# *oldBalanceDest* and *newBalanceDest* can both be 0, these conditions do not

# It can be easily seen that transactions with *isFlaggedFraud* 
# set occur at
# all values of *step*, similar to the complementary set of transactions. Thus
# *isFlaggedFraud* does not correlate with *step* either and is therefore
# seemingly unrelated to any explanatory variable or feature in the data

# *Conclusion*: Although *isFraud* is always set when *isFlaggedFraud* is set, since
# *isFlaggedFraud* is set just 16 times in a seemingly meaningless way, we 
# can treat this feature as insignificant and discard it in the dataset 
# without loosing information.

# ##### 2.3. Are expected merchant accounts accordingly labelled?

# It was stated <a href='http://www2.bth.se/com/edl.nsf/pages/phd-dissertation'>[5]</a> that CASH_IN involves being paid by
# a merchant (whose name is prefixed by 'M'). However, as shown below, the present data does not have

# In[ ]:


print('\nAre there any merchants among originator accounts for CASH_IN transactions? {}'.format((df.loc[df.type == 'CASH_IN'].nameOrig.str.contains('M')).any())) # False

# there are no merchants among the destination accounts.

# In[ ]:


print('\nAre there any merchants among destination accounts for CASH_OUT transactions? {}'.format((df.loc[df.type == 'CASH_OUT'].nameDest.str.contains('M')).any())) # False

print('\nAre there any transactions having merchants among destination accounts other than the PAYMENT type? {}'.format((df.loc[df.nameDest.str.contains('M')].type != 'PAYMENT').any())) # False


# *Conclusion*: Among the account labels *nameOrig* and *nameDest*, for all transactions, the merchant prefix of 'M' occurs in an unexpected way.

# <a href='#top'>back to top</a>

# <a id='common-accounts'></a>
# ##### 2.4. Are there account labels common to fraudulent TRANSFERs and CASH_OUTs?

# From the data description, the modus operandi for committing fraud involves 
# first making a TRANSFER to a (fraudulent) account which in turn 
# conducts a CASH_OUT.
# CASH_OUT involves transacting with a merchant who
# pays out cash.
# Thus, within this two-step process, the fraudulent account would be both, 
# the destination in a TRANSFER
# and the originator in a CASH_OUT. However, the data shows below that there are no 
# such common accounts among 
# fraudulent transactions. Thus, the data is not imprinted with
# the expected modus-operandi.

# In[ ]:


print('\nWithin fraudulent transactions, are there destinations for TRANSFERS that are also originators for CASH_OUTs? {}'.format((dfFraudTransfer.nameDest.isin(dfFraudCashout.nameOrig)).any())) # False

# Could destination accounts for fraudulent TRANSFERs originate CASHOUTs that
# are not detected and are labeled as genuine? It turns out there are  3 such
# accounts.

print('\nFraudulent TRANSFERs whose destination accounts are originators of genuine CASH_OUTs: \n\n{}'.format(dfFraudTransfer.loc[dfFraudTransfer.nameDest.isin(dfNotFraud.loc[dfNotFraud.type == 'CASH_OUT'].nameOrig.drop_duplicates())]))


# However, 2 out of 3 of these accounts first make a genuine CASH_OUT and 
# only later 
# (as evidenced by the
# time step) receive a fraudulent TRANSFER. Thus, fraudulent transactions are
# not indicated by the *nameOrig* and *nameDest* features.

# In[ ]:


print('\nFraudulent TRANSFER to C423543548 occured at step = 486 whereas genuine CASH_OUT from this account occured earlier at step = {}'.format(dfNotFraud.loc[(dfNotFraud.type == 'CASH_OUT') & (dfNotFraud.nameOrig ==                            'C423543548')].step.values)) # 185


# *Conclusion*: Noting from section <a href='#merchant'>2.3</a>
# above that
# the *nameOrig* and *nameDest* features neither encode merchant accounts in the expected way, below, we
# drop these features from the data since they are meaningless.

# <a id='clean'></a>
# #### 3. Data cleaning

# From the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of section <a href='#EDA#'>2</a>, we know that fraud only occurs in 
# 'TRANSFER's and 'CASH_OUT's. So we assemble only the corresponding data in X
# for analysis.

# In[ ]:

randomState = 5
np.random.seed(randomState)

#X = X.loc[np.random.choice(X.index, 100000, replace = False)]

# Eliminate columns shown to be irrelevant for analysis in the EDA
X = X.drop(['nameOrig', 'nameDest', 'isFlaggedFraud'], axis = 1)

# <a id='imputation'></a>
# ##### 3.1. Imputation of Latent Missing Values

# The data has several transactions with zero balances in the destination 
# account both before and after a non-zero amount is transacted. The fraction
# of such transactions, where zero likely denotes a missing value, is much 
# larger
# in fraudulent (50%) compared to genuine transactions (0.06%).

# In[ ]:


Xfraud = X.loc[Y == 1]
XnonFraud = X.loc[Y == 0]
print('\nThe fraction of fraudulent transactions with \'oldBalanceDest\' = \'newBalanceDest\' = 0 although the transacted \'amount\' is non-zero is: {}'.format(len(Xfraud.loc[(Xfraud.oldBalanceDest == 0) & (Xfraud.newBalanceDest == 0) & (Xfraud.amount)]) / (1.0 * len(Xfraud))))

print('\nThe fraction of genuine transactions with \'oldBalanceDest\' = newBalanceDest\' = 0 although the transacted \'amount\' is non-zero is: {}'.format(len(XnonFraud.loc[(XnonFraud.oldBalanceDest == 0) & (XnonFraud.newBalanceDest == 0) & (XnonFraud.amount)]) / (1.0 * len(XnonFraud))))


# Since the destination account balances being zero is a strong indicator of
# fraud, we do not impute the account balance (before the transaction is made)
# with a statistic or from a distribution with a subsequent adjustment for 
# the amount transacted. Doing so would mask this
# indicator of fraud and make fraudulent transactions appear genuine. Instead,
# below we
# replace the value of 0 with -1
# which will be more useful to a suitable machine-learning (ML) algorithm detecting 
# fraud.

# In[ ]:


X.loc[(X.oldBalanceDest == 0) & (X.newBalanceDest == 0) & (X.amount != 0),       ['oldBalanceDest', 'newBalanceDest']] = - 1


# The data also has several transactions with zero balances in the originating
# account both before and after a non-zero amount is transacted. In this case,
# the fraction of such transactions is much smaller in fraudulent (0.3%)
# compared to genuine transactions (47%). Once again, from similar reasoning as
# above, instead of imputing a 
# numerical value we replace the value of 0 with a null value.

# #### 4. Feature-engineering

# Motivated by the possibility of zero-balances serving to differentiate between
# fraudulent and genuine transactions, we take the data-imputation of section <a href='#imputation'>3.1</a> a
# step further and create 2 new features (columns) recording errors in the 
# originating and
# destination accounts for each transaction. These new features turn out to be 
# important in obtaining the best performance from the ML algorithm that we will
# finally use.

# #### 5. Data visualization

# The best way of

# #### 6. Machine Learning to Detect Fraud in Skewed Data

# Having obtained evidence from the plots above that the data now contains 
# features that
# make fraudulent transactions clearly 
# detectable, the remaining obstacle for training a robust ML model is the highly 
# imbalanced
# nature of the data.

# In[ ]:


print('skew = {}'.format( len(Xfraud) / float(len(X)) ))


# *Selection of metric*: 
# Since the data is highly skewed, I use the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) rather than the conventional area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). This is because the AUPRC is more sensitive to differences between algorithms and their parameter settings rather than the AUROC (see <a href='http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jdavis/davisgoadrichcamera2.pdf'>Davis and Goadrich, 2006</a>).

# *Selection of ML algorithm*: A first approach to deal with imbalanced data is to balance it by discarding the majority class before applying an ML algorithm. The disadvantage of  undersampling is that a model trained in this way will not perform well on real-world skewed test data since almost all the information was discarded. A better approach might be to oversample the minority class, say by the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) contained in the 'imblearn' library. Motivated by this, I tried a variety of anomaly-detection and supervised learning approaches. I find, however, that the best result is obtained on the original dataset by using a ML algorithm based on ensembles of decision trees that intrinsically performs well on imbalanced data. Such algorithms not only allow for constructing a model that can cope with the missing values in our data, but they naturally allow for speedup via parallel-processing. Among these algorithms, the extreme gradient-boosted (XGBoost) algorithm used below slightly outperforms random-forest. Finally, XGBoost, like several other ML algorithms, allows for weighting the positive class more compared to the negative class --- a setting that also allows to account for the skew in the data.

# ##### 6.3. Bias-variance tradeoff

# The model we have learnt has a degree of bias and is slighly underfit. This is indicated by the levelling in AUPRC as the size of the training set is increased in the cross-validation curve below. The easiest way to improve the performance of the model still further is to increase the *max_depth* parameter of the XGBClassifier at the expense of the longer time spent learning the model. Other parameters of the classifier that can be adjusted to correct for the effect of the modest underfitting include decreasing *min_child_weight* and decreasing *reg_lambda*.

# #### 7. Conclusion

# We thoroughly interrogated the data at the outset to gain insight into which features could be discarded and those which could be valuably engineered. The plots provided visual confirmation that the data could be indeed be discriminated with the aid of the new features. To deal with the large skew in the data, we chose an appropriate metric and used an ML algorithm based on an ensemble of decision trees which works best with strongly imbalanced classes. The method used in this kernel should therefore be broadly applicable to a range of such problems.
