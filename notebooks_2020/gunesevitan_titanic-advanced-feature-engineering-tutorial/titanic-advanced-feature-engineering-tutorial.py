# ## **0. Introduction**
# 
# I decided to write this kernel because **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is one of my favorite competitions on Kaggle. This is a beginner level kernel which focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Feature Engineering**. A lot of people start Kaggle with this competition and they get lost in extremely long tutorial kernels. This is a short kernel compared to the other ones. I hope this will be a good guide for starters and inspire them with new feature engineering ideas.
# 
# **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is a great competition to apply domain knowledge for feature engineering, so I made a research and learned a lot about Titanic. There are many secrets to be revealed beneath the Titanic dataset. I tried to find out some of those secret factors that had affected the survival of passengers when the Titanic was sinking. I believe there are other features still waiting to be discovered. 
# 
# This kernel has **3** main sections; **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Feature Engineering** and **Model**, and it can achieve top **2%** (**0.83732**) public leaderboard score with a tuned Random Forest Classifier. It takes 60 seconds to run whole notebook. If you have any idea that might improve this kernel, please be sure to comment, or fork and experiment as you like. If you didn't understand any part, feel free to ask.

# ## **1. Exploratory Data Analysis**

# ### **1.1 Overview**
# * `PassengerId` is the unique id of the row and it doesn't have any effect on target
# * `Survived` is the target variable we are trying to predict (**0** or **1**):
#     - **1 = Survived**
#     - **0 = Not Survived**
# * `Pclass` (Passenger Class) is the socio-economic status of the passenger and it is a categorical ordinal feature which has **3** unique values (**1**,  **2 **or **3**):
#     - **1 = Upper Class**
#     - **2 = Middle Class**
#     - **3 = Lower Class**
# * `Name`, `Sex` and `Age` are self-explanatory
# * `SibSp` is the total number of the passengers' siblings and spouse
# * `Parch` is the total number of the passengers' parents and children
# * `Ticket` is the ticket number of the passenger
# * `Fare` is the passenger fare
# * `Cabin` is the cabin number of the passenger
# * `Embarked` is port of embarkation and it is a categorical feature which has **3** unique values (**C**, **Q** or **S**):
#     - **C = Cherbourg**
#     - **Q = Queenstown**
#     - **S = Southampton**

df_test.sample(3)


# ### **1.2 Missing Values**
# As seen from below, some columns have missing values. `display_missing` function shows the count of missing values in every column in both training and test set.
# * Training set have missing values in `Age`, `Cabin` and `Embarked` columns
# * Test set have missing values in `Age`, `Cabin` and `Fare` columns
# 
# It is convenient to work on concatenated training and test set while dealing with missing values, otherwise filled data may overfit to training or test set samples. The count of missing values in `Age`, `Embarked` and `Fare` are smaller compared to total sample, but roughly **80%** of the `Cabin` is missing. Missing values in `Age`, `Embarked` and `Fare` can be filled with descriptive statistical measures but that wouldn't work for `Cabin`.

# In[ ]:


def display_missing(df):    
    for col in df.columns.tolist():          
        print('{} column missing values: {}'.format(col, df[col].isnull().sum()))
    print('\n')
    
for df in dfs:
    print('{}'.format(df.name))
    display_missing(df)


# #### **1.2.1 Age**
# Missing values in `Age` are filled with median age, but using median age of the whole data set is not a good choice. Median age of `Pclass` groups is the best choice because of its high correlation with `Age` **(0.408106)** and `Survived` **(0.338481)**. It is also more logical to group ages by passenger classes instead of other features.

# In[ ]:


df_all_corr = df_all.corr().abs().unstack().sort_values(kind="quicksort", ascending=False).reset_index()
df_all_corr.rename(columns={"level_0": "Feature 1", "level_1": "Feature 2", 0: 'Correlation Coefficient'}, inplace=True)
df_all_corr[df_all_corr['Feature 1'] == 'Age']


# In order to be more accurate, `Sex` feature is used as the second level of `groupby` while filling the missing `Age` values. As seen from below, `Pclass` and `Sex` groups have distinct median `Age` values. When passenger class increases, the median age for both males and females also increases. However, females tend to have slightly lower median `Age` than males. The median ages below are used for filling the missing values in `Age` feature.

# In[ ]:


age_by_pclass_sex = df_all.groupby(['Sex', 'Pclass']).median()['Age']

for pclass in range(1, 4):
    for sex in ['female', 'male']:
        print('Median age of Pclass {} {}s: {}'.format(pclass, sex, age_by_pclass_sex[sex][pclass]))
print('Median age of all passengers: {}'.format(df_all['Age'].median()))

# Filling the missing values in Age with the medians of Sex and Pclass groups
df_all['Age'] = df_all.groupby(['Sex', 'Pclass'])['Age'].apply(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))


# #### **1.2.2 Embarked**
# `Embarked` is a categorical feature and there are only **2** missing values in whole data set. Both of those passengers are female, upper class and they have the same ticket number. This means that they know each other and embarked from the same port together. The mode `Embarked` value for an upper class female passenger is **C (Cherbourg)**, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they embarked from that port.

# In[ ]:


df_all[df_all['Embarked'].isnull()]


# When I googled **Stone, Mrs. George Nelson (Martha Evelyn)**, I found that she embarked from **S (Southampton)** with her maid **Amelie Icard**, in this page [Martha Evelyn Stone: Titanic Survivor](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/martha-evelyn-stone.html).
# 
# > *Mrs Stone boarded the Titanic in Southampton on 10 April 1912 and was travelling in first class with her maid Amelie Icard. She occupied cabin B-28.*
# 
# Missing values in `Embarked` are filled with **S** with this information.

# In[ ]:


# Filling the missing values in Embarked with S
df_all['Embarked'] = df_all['Embarked'].fillna('S')


# #### **1.2.3 Fare**
# There is only one passenger with missing `Fare` value. We can assume that `Fare` is related to family size (`Parch` and `SibSp`) and `Pclass` features. Median `Fare` value of a male with a third class ticket and no family is a logical choice to fill the missing value.

med_fare = df_all.groupby(['Pclass', 'Parch', 'SibSp']).Fare.median()[3][0][0]
# Filling the missing value in Fare with the median Fare of 3rd class alone passenger
df_all['Fare'] = df_all['Fare'].fillna(med_fare)


# #### **1.2.4 Cabin**
# `Cabin` feature is little bit tricky and it needs further exploration. The large portion of the `Cabin` feature is missing and the feature itself can't be ignored completely because some the cabins might have higher survival rates. It turns out to be the first letter of the `Cabin` values are the decks in which the cabins are located. Those decks were mainly separated for one passenger class, but some of them were used by multiple passenger classes.
# ![alt text](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/titanic/images/f/f9/Titanic_side_plan.png/revision/latest?cb=20180322183733)
# * On the Boat Deck there were **6** rooms labeled as **T, U, W, X, Y, Z** but only the **T** cabin is present in the dataset
# * **A**, **B** and **C** decks were only for 1st class passengers
# * **D** and **E** decks were for all classes
# * **F** and **G** decks were for both 2nd and 3rd class passengers
# * From going **A** to **G**, distance to the staircase increases which might be a factor of survival

# As I suspected, every deck has different survival rates and that information can't be discarded. Deck **B**, **C**, **D** and **E** have the highest survival rates. Those decks are mostly occupied by 1st class passengers. **M** has the lowest survival rate which is mostly occupied by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. To conclude, cabins used by 1st class passengers have higher survival rates than cabins used by 2nd and 3rd class passengers. In my opinion **M** (Missing `Cabin` values) has the lowest survival rate because they couldn't retrieve the cabin data of the victims. That's why I believe labeling that group as **M** is a reasonable way to handle the missing data. It is a unique group with shared characteristics. `Deck` feature has high-cardinality right now so some of the values are grouped with each other based on their similarities.
# * **A**, **B** and **C** decks are labeled as **ABC** because all of them have only 1st class passengers
# * **D** and **E** decks are labeled as **DE** because both of them have similar passenger class distribution and same survival rate
# * **F** and **G** decks are labeled as **FG** because of the same reason above
# * **M** deck doesn't need to be grouped with other decks because it is very different from others and has the lowest survival rate.

# ### **1.6 Conclusion**
# Most of the features are correlated with each other. This relationship can be used to create new features with feature transformation and feature interaction. Target encoding could be very useful as well because of the high correlations with `Survived` feature.
# 
# Split points and spikes are visible in continuous features. They can be captured easily with a decision tree model, but linear models may not be able to spot them.
# 
# Categorical features have very distinct distributions with different survival rates. Those features can be one-hot encoded. Some of those features may be combined with each other to make new features.
# 
# Created a new feature called `Deck` and dropped `Cabin` feature at the **Exploratory Data Analysis** part.

# #### **2.1.1 Fare**
# `Fare` feature is positively skewed and survival rate is extremely high on the right end. **13** quantile based bins are used for `Fare` feature. Even though the bins are too much, they provide decent amount of information gain. The groups at the left side of the graph has the lowest survival rate and the groups at the right side of the graph has the highest survival rate. This high survival rate was not visible in the distribution graph. There is also an unusual group **(15.742, 23.25]** in the middle with high survival rate that is captured in this process.

# ### **2.2 Frequency Encoding**
# `Family_Size` is created by adding `SibSp`, `Parch` and **1**. `SibSp` is the count of siblings and spouse, and `Parch` is the count of parents and children. Those columns are added in order to find the total size of families. Adding **1** at the end, is the current passenger. Graphs have clearly shown that family size is a predictor of survival because different values have different survival rates.
# * Family Size with **1** are labeled as **Alone**
# * Family Size with **2**, **3** and **4** are labeled as **Small**

# There are too many unique `Ticket` values to analyze, so grouping them up by their frequencies makes things easier.
# 
# **How is this feature different than `Family_Size`?** Many passengers travelled along with groups. Those groups consist of friends, nannies, maids and etc. They weren't counted as family, but they used the same ticket.
# 
# **Why not grouping tickets by their prefixes?** If prefixes in `Ticket` feature has any meaning, then they are already captured in `Pclass` or `Embarked` features because that could be the only logical information which can be derived from the `Ticket` feature.
# 
# According to the graph below, groups with **2**,**3** and **4** members had a higher survival rate. Passengers who travel alone has the lowest survival rate. After **4** group members, survival rate decreases drastically. This pattern is very similar to `Family_Size` feature but there are minor differences. `Ticket_Frequency` values are not grouped like `Family_Size` because that would basically create the same feature with perfect correlation. This kind of feature wouldn't provide any additional information gain.

It is given to male passengers below age **26**. They have the highest survival rate among all males.

# 
# `Name` feature is very useful. First, `Title` and `Is_Married` features are created from the title prefix in the names. Second, `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Family_Survival_Rate_NA`  features are created by target encoding the surname of the passengers. `Ticket_Survival_Rate` is created by target encoding the `Ticket` feature. `Survival_Rate` feature is created by averaging the `Family_Survival_Rate` and `Ticket_Survival_Rate` features.
# 
# Finally, the non-numeric type features are label encoded and categorical features are one-hot encoded. Created **5** new features (`Family_Size`, `Title`, `Is_Married`, `Survival_Rate` and `Survival_Rate_NA`) and dropped the useless features after encoding.

# ### **3.1 Random Forest**
# Created 2 `RandomForestClassifier`'s. One of them is a single model and the other is for k-fold cross validation.
# 
# The highest accuracy of the `single_best_model` is **0.82775** in public leaderboard. However, it doesn't perform better in k-fold cross validation. It is a good model to start experimenting and hyperparameter tuning.
# 
# The highest accuracy of `leaderboard_model` is **0.83732** in public leaderboard with 5-fold cross validation. This model is created for leaderboard score and it is tuned to overfit slightly. It is designed to overfit because the estimated probabilities of `X_test` in every fold are going to be divided by **N** (fold count). If this model is used as a single model, it would struggle to predict lots of samples correctly.

# **Which model should I use?** 
# * `leaderboard_model` overfits to test set so it's not suggested to use models like this in real life projects.
# * `single_best_model` is a good model to start experimenting and learning about decision trees.
